= pkl-html-highlighter

This tool produces HTML that highlights Pcl source code using Highlight.js style syntax (e.g. `<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span>`).

== Building

To build, run:

[source,shell script]
----
$ cargo build
----

This places a binary at `target/debug/pkl-html-highlighter`.

== Future improvements

This tool is a hack to get syntax highlighting working properly on the Pkl website.

Some possible improvements:

* Compile this repository as a library to WebAssembly. This means we no longer have to compile a binary, and can import the `.wasm` files directly into Node.js.
* Write a syntax highligter entirely in JavaScript and eliminate this tool altogether.
