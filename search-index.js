The host application has access to low level controls. It is able to manage the lifecycle of evaluators, as well as provide custom modules and resources to Pkl. Currently, Pkl must be embedded as a child process, by shelling out to the CLI using the pkl server command. In the future, a C library will also be provided. When embedded, communication between a host application and Pkl happens via message passing. The message passing specification can be found in Message Passing API. For examples of language bindings in practice, review the pkl-go, or the pkl-swift codebases. Pkl’s Java and Kotlin libraries binds to Pkl directly, and do not use message passing. A language binding for Pkl should generally have the following components: A client that spawns pkl server, and talks to it using message passing. A deserializer that turns pkl binary encoding into a structure in the host language. A code generator that transforms Pkl schemas into schemas written in the host language. The code generator is mostly written in Pkl, with a lightweight executable that acts as the glue layer. For examples of code generators, consult pkl-go and pkl-swift. Here is a sample flow for evaluating a module with the following contents: file:///path/to/myModule.pkl module MyModule theModules = import*(\"customfs:/*.pkl\") Client sends Create Evaluator Request, including customfs as a custom module reader.

[ 0x21, { \"requestId\": 135, \"evaluatorId\": -135901 } ] Client sends Evaluate Request, providing the module’s URI. [ 0x23, { \"requestId\": 9805131, \"evaluatorId\": -13901, \"moduleUri\": \"file:///path/to/myModule.pkl\" } ] During evaluation, server evaluates import*(\"customfs:/*.pkl\"), and sends List Modules Request.

The first element of the array is a code that designates the message’s type, encoded as an int. The second element of the array is the message body, encoded as a map. Messages are passed between the client and the server. When hosting Pkl (for example, the Swift application when using pkl-swift), the client is the host program and the server is the entity that provides controls for interacting with Pkl. When implementing an external reader, the client is the external reader process and the server is the Pkl evaluator.

The benefits of code generation are: Configuration can be conveniently consumed as statically typed Java objects. The entire configuration tree can be code-completed in Java IDEs. Any drift between Java code and Pkl configuration structure is caught at compile time. The generated classes are immutable and have component-wise implementations of equals(), hashCode(), and toString(). The code generator is offered as Gradle plugin, Java library, and CLI. See Installation in the Gradle plugin chapter. The pkl-codegen-java library is available from Maven Central. It requires Java 17 or higher. To use the library in a Gradle project, declare the following dependency: Kotlin Groovy build.gradle.kts dependencies { implementation(\"org.pkl-lang:pkl-codegen-java:0.27.1\") } repositories { mavenCentral() } build.gradle dependencies { implementation \"org.pkl-lang:pkl-codegen-java:0.27.1\" } repositories { mavenCentral() } To use the library in a Maven project, declare the following dependency: pom.xml org.pkl-lang pkl-codegen-java 0.27.1 The CLI is bundled with the Java library. As we do not currently ship the CLI as a self-contained Jar, we recommend to provision it with a Maven compatible build tool as shown in Java Library. The code generator is offered as Gradle plugin, Java library, and CLI. See Java Code Generation in the Gradle plugin chapter. The Java library offers two APIs: a high-level API that corresponds to the CLI, and a lower-level API that provides additional features and control. The entry points for these APIs are org.pkl.codegen.java.CliJavaCodeGenerator and org.pkl.codegen.java.JavaCodeGenerator, respectively. For more information, refer to the Javadoc documentation. As explained in Installation, the CLI is bundled with the Java library. To run the CLI, execute the library Jar or its org.pkl.codegen.java.Main main class. Synopsis: java -cp -jar pkl-codegen-java.jar [] The absolute or relative URIs of the modules to generate classes for. Relative URIs are resolved against the working directory. --generate-getters Default: (flag not set) Flag that indicates to generate private final fields and public getter methods instead of public final fields. --generate-javadoc Default: (flag not set) Flag that indicates to generate Javadoc based on doc comments for Pkl modules, classes, and properties. --params-annotation Default: org.pkl.config.java.mapper.Named Fully qualified name of the annotation to use on constructor parameters. --non-null-annotation Default: org.pkl.config.java.mapper.NonNull Fully qualified named of the annotation class to use for non-null types. This annotation is required to have java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE as a @Target or it may generate code that does not compile. Common code generator options: --indent Default: \" \" (two spaces) Example: \"\\t\" (one tab) The characters to use for indenting generated source code. -o, --output-dir Default: (not set) Example: generated/ The directory where generated source code is placed. Relative paths are resolved against the working directory. --generate-spring-boot Default: (not set) Flag that indicates to generate config classes for use with Spring Boot. --implement-serializable Default: (not set) Whether to make generated classes implement java.io.Serializable. --rename Default: (none) Example: foo.=com.example.foo. Allows to change default class and package names (derived from Pkl module names) in the generated code. When you need the generated class or package names to be different from the default names derived from the Pkl module names, you can define a rename mapping, where the key is the original Pkl module name prefix, and the value is its replacement. When you do, the generated code’s package declarations, class names, as well as file locations, will be modified according to this mapping. The prefixes are replaced literally, which means that dots at the end are important. If you want to rename packages only, in most cases, you must ensure that you have an ending dot on both sides of a mapping (except for an empty mapping, if you use it), otherwise you may get unexpected results: // Assuming the following arguments: --rename com.foo.=x // Dot on the left only --rename org.bar=y. // Dot on the right only --rename net.baz=z // No dots // The following renames will be made: \"com.foo.bar\" -> \"xbar\" // Target prefix merged into the suffix \"org.bar.baz\" -> \"y..baz\" // Double dot, invalid name \"net.baz.qux\" -> \"z.qux\" // Looks okay, but... \"net.bazqux\" -> \"zqux\" // ...may cut the name in the middle. When computing the appropriate target name, the longest matching prefix is used: // Assuming the following arguments: --rename com.foo.Main=w.Main --rename com.foo.=x. --rename com.=y. --rename =z. // The following renames will be made: com.foo.Main -> w.Main com.foo.bar -> x.bar com.baz.qux -> y.baz.qux org.foo.bar -> z.org.foo.bar Repeat this option to define multiple mappings. Keys can be arbitrary strings, including an empty string. Values must be valid dot-separated fully qualified class name prefixes, possibly terminated by a dot. Common CLI options: --allowed-modules Default: pkl:,file:,modulepath:,https:,repl:,package:,projectpackage: Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which modules can be loaded and evaluated. Patterns are matched against the beginning of module URIs. (File paths have been converted to file: URLs at this stage.) At least one pattern needs to match for a module to be loadable. --allowed-resources Default: env:,prop:,package:,projectpackage: Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which external resources can be read. Patterns are matched against the beginning of resource URIs. At least one pattern needs to match for a resource to be readable. --color Default: auto When to format messages with ANSI color codes. Possible values: \"never\": Never format \"auto\": Format if stdin, stdout, or stderr are connected to a console. \"always\": Always format --cache-dir Default: ~/.pkl/cache Example: /path/to/module/cache/ The cache directory for storing packages. --no-cache Disable caching of packages. -e, --env-var Default: OS environment variables for the current process Example: MY_VAR=myValue Sets an environment variable that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"env:\"). Repeat this option to set multiple environment variables. -h, --help Display help information. --module-path Default: (empty) Example: dir1:zip1.zip:jar1.jar Directories, ZIP archives, or JAR archives to search when resolving modulepath: URIs. Paths are separated by the platform-specific path separator (: on *nix, ; on Windows). Relative paths are resolved against the working directory. -p, --property Default: (none) Example: myProp=myValue Sets an external property that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"prop:\"). Repeat this option to set multiple external properties. --root-dir Default: (none) Example: /some/path Root directory for file: modules and resources. If set, access to file-based modules and resources is restricted to those located under the specified root directory. Any symlinks are resolved before this check is performed. --settings Default: (none) Example: mySettings.pkl File path of the Pkl settings file to use. If not set, ~/.pkl/settings.pkl or defaults specified in the pkl.settings standard library module are used. -t, --timeout Default: (none) Example: 30 Duration, in seconds, after which evaluation of a source module will be timed out. Note that a timeout is treated the same as a program error in that any subsequent source modules will not be evaluated. -v, --version Display version information. -w, --working-dir Base path that relative module paths passed as command-line arguments are resolved against. Defaults to the current working directory. --ca-certificates Default: (none) Example: /some/path/certificates.pem Path to a file containing CA certificates to be used for TLS connections. Setting this option replaces the existing set of CA certificates bundled into the CLI. Certificates need to be X.509 certificates in PEM format. For other methods of configuring certificates, see CA Certificates. --http-proxy Default: (none) Example: http://proxy.example.com:1234 Configures HTTP connections to connect to the provided proxy address. The URI must have scheme http, and may not contain anything other than a host and port. --http-no-proxy Default: (none) Example: example.com,169.254.0.0/16 Comma separated list of hosts to which all connections should bypass the proxy. Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation.

To use the library in a Gradle project, declare the following dependency: Kotlin Groovy build.gradle.kts dependencies { implementation(\"org.pkl-lang:pkl-config-java:0.27.1\") } repositories { mavenCentral() } build.gradle dependencies { implementation \"org.pkl-lang:pkl-config-java:0.27.1\" } repositories { mavenCentral() } Unlike pkl-config-java, pkl-config-java-all is a fat Jar with renamed third-party packages to avoid version conflicts.

The ConfigEvaluator class loads and evaluates Pkl modules. If evaluation succeeds, a Config object is returned. Otherwise, a PklException with error details is thrown. The returned Config object represents the root of the Pkl configuration tree. Intermediate and leaf nodes are also represented as Config objects. Config objects offer methods to convert their Pkl value to a Java value of the specified type. navigate to child nodes. Let’s see this in action: Config config; try (var evaluator = ConfigEvaluator.preconfigured()) { (1) config = evaluator.evaluate( ModuleSource.text(\"pigeon { age = 5; diet = new Listing { \\\"Seeds\\\" } }\")); (2) } var pigeon = config.get(\"pigeon\"); (3) var age = pigeon.get(\"age\").as(int.class); (4) var diet = pigeon.get(\"diet\").as(JavaType.listOf(String.class)); (5) 1 Create a preconfigured ConfigEvaluator. To create a customized evaluator, start from ConfigEvaluatorBuilder.preconfigured() or ConfigEvaluatorBuilder.unconfigured(). The evaluator should be closed once it is no longer needed. In this example, this is done with a try-with-resources statement. Note that objects returned by the evaluator remain valid after calling close(). 2 Evaluate the given text. Other evaluate methods read from files, URLs, and other sources. If evaluation fails, an PklException is thrown. 3 Navigate from the config root to its \"pigeon\" child. 4 Navigate from \"pigeon\" to \"age\" and get the latter’s value as an int. If conversion to the requested type fails, a ConversionException is thrown. 5 Navigate from \"pigeon\" to \"diet\" and get the latter’s value as a List. Note the use of JavaType.listOf() for creating a parameterized type literal. Similar methods exist for sets, maps, and other generic types. A ConfigEvaluator caches module sources and evaluation results. To clear the cache, for example to evaluate the same module again, close the evaluator and create a new one. For a ready-to-go example with full source code, see config-java in the pkl-jvm-examples repository. When a Config object needs to convert its Pkl value to a Java value, it delegates the conversion to ValueMapper. ValueMapper can convert an entire PModule or any part thereof. A ValueMapper instance can be configured with many different Pkl-to-Java value conversions. ValueMapper.preconfigured() creates an instance configured with conversions from Pkl values to: Number types Strings Enums Collections Arrays java.util.Optional java.time.Duration java.net.URI/URL etc. Additionally, a preconfigured ValueMapper instance can convert Pkl objects to Java objects with equally named properties that are settable through a constructor. This conversion works as follows: Find the Java class constructor with the highest number of parameters. Match constructor parameters with Pkl object properties by name. Unmatched constructor parameters result in a conversion error. Unmatched Pkl object properties are ignored. Convert each Pkl property value to the corresponding constructor parameter’s type. Invoke the constructor. The Pkl object’s runtime type is irrelevant to this conversion. Hence, typed and dynamic Pkl objects are equally supported. To perform this conversion, ValueMapper needs a way to obtain the Java constructor’s parameter names. They need to be provided in one of the following ways: Annotate constructor with java.beans.ConstructorProperties. Annotate parameters with Named. Annotate parameters with javax.inject.Named. Set the Java compiler flag -parameters. For a complete object mapping example, see: PObjectToDataObjectTest.java Together with code generation, object mapping provides a complete solution for consuming Pkl configuration as statically typed Java objects. Java code never drifts from the configuration structure defined in Pkl, and the entire configuration tree can be code-completed in Java IDEs. The Pkl-to-Java value conversions that ship with the library are defined in Conversions (for individual conversions) and ConverterFactories (for families of conversions). To implement and register your own conversions, follow these steps: For conversions from a single source type to a single target type, implement a Conversion. Example: Conversions.pStringToCharacter converts a single-character pkl.base#String to java.lang.Character. For conversions from one or multiple source types to one or multiple target types, implement a ConverterFactory. Example: ConverterFactories.pCollectionToCollection converts any pkl.base#Collection to any implementation of java.util.Collection, for any E. Converter factories are called once per combination of source type and (possibly parameterized) target type. The returned `Converter`s are cached. Create a ValueMapperBuilder, add all desired conversions, and build a ValueMapper. Either use the ValueMapper directly, or connect it to a ConfigEvaluator through ConfigEvaluatorBuilder. Refer to the Javadoc and sources published with the library, or browse the library’s main and test sources.","title":"pkl-config-java Library","component":"main","version":"0.27.1","name":"pkl-config-java","url":"/main/current/java-binding/pkl-config-java.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"installation","id":1},{"text":"Gradle","hash":"gradle","id":2},{"text":"Maven","hash":"maven","id":3},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage","id":4},{"text":"Consuming Configuration","hash":"consuming-configuration","id":5},{"text":"Object Mapping","hash":"object-mapping","id":6},{"text":"Value Conversions","hash":"value-conversions","id":7},{"text":"Further Information","hash":"further-information","id":8}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"Configuration is often described in a static configuration format or is generated with a general-purpose programming language. This page lists shortcomings of these approaches and explains how Pkl addresses them. Also, Pkl’s strong and weak points in comparison to other configuration languages are discussed in this document. Static configuration formats such as JSON, YAML, TOML, and XML work reasonably well for simple configuration needs. However, they do have some shortcomings, including: They are not very human-friendly to read and write. (JSON, XML) They do not provide a way to split a large file into multiple smaller ones. (JSON, YAML, TOML) They offer no way or very limited ways to abstract over repetitive configuration. (JSON, YAML, TOML, XML) They do not offer standardized or widely available schema validators. (JSON, YAML, TOML) They offer little or no schema-aware tooling. (JSON, YAML, TOML) Pkl addresses these shortcomings as follows: It has a clutter-free and familiar syntax with nestable comments. Modules can import other modules from local and remote locations. Every object can act as a template for other objects. The standard library offers strong support for data manipulation. It has strong built-in support for describing and validating configuration schemas. It is designed to enable schema-aware tooling, such as REPLs and editors with code completion support. When configuration needs outgrow the capabilities of static configuration formats, projects often turn to generate configuration with a general-purpose programming language such as Python. Given enough effort, this approach can satisfy complex configuration needs. However, expressing configuration in a full-blown programming language does have some shortcomings, including: Reading, writing, and debugging configuration can become as challenging as reading, writing, and debugging application code. The host language may not be a good fit for describing, manipulating, and abstracting over hierarchical configuration. Configuration code may not visually resemble the configuration it generates. The host language may not be a good fit for defining and validating configuration schemas. Development environments may offer little help for developing and validating configuration written in the host language. General-purpose languages are powerful and often difficult to sandbox. Are you certain your configuration script isn’t erasing your hard disk or launching a rocket? Pkl addresses these shortcomings as follows: As an expression-oriented and side-effect free language, it eliminates many potential sources of errors. It is specifically designed for describing, manipulating, and abstracting over hierarchical configuration. Pkl code often resembles the configuration it generates. It has strong built-in support for defining and validating configuration schemas. It is designed to enable advanced and schema-aware tooling. It is comparatively powerless and strictly sandboxed, making fatal configuration mistakes and exploits less likely. Till now, we haven’t spotted any Pkl script capable of erasing your hard disk. Compared to open-source configuration languages such as Jsonnet, HCL, and Dhall, Pkl’s strong points are: General Pkl has a clean and familiar syntax, which makes it easier to read and learn. Pkl supports writing sophisticated schemas, which enables config validation, code and documentation generation, and advanced IDE support. This is Pkl’s most significant differentiator, and is the main reason why we created it. Pkl has stronger templating capabilities than other config languages, reducing user code to the absolute minimum. Embedding Pkl is great for embedding into JVM applications. Pkl offers modern JVM libraries for runtime application configuration. Pkl supports code generation to enable statically typed access to configuration from programming languages. Pkl integrates with third-party (Spring Boot) JVM libraries and frameworks. Tooling Pkl has a polished documentation generator that produces highly navigable and searchable documentation. Pkl offers a Gradle plugin to easily integrate code evaluation, documentation generation, and code generation into your builds. Pkl’s native executables have a JIT compiler that can speed up evaluation up to hundred times. On the other hand, we believe that Pkl’s weak points are: Pkl’s native binaries are larger than those of other config languages. Pkl is less known and has a smaller community than some other config languages. We are working towards making Pkl overcome these weakness. Please support us in reaching this goal! We hope that you will enjoy Pkl, and that you trust us to gradually improve its weak points.","title":"Comparison","component":"main","version":"0.27.1","name":"comparison","url":"/main/current/introduction/comparison.html","titles":[{"text":"Pkl vs. Static Config Formats","hash":"static-config-formats","id":1},{"text":"Pkl vs. General-purpose Languages","hash":"general-purpose-langs","id":2},{"text":"Pkl vs. Other Config Languages","hash":"other-config-langs","id":3}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"Let’s get to know Pkl by discussing some of its concepts and features. Configuration tends to grow larger and more complex over time, making it increasingly difficult to understand and maintain. Pkl can reduce the size and complexity of configuration by describing similar configuration elements in terms of their differences introducing abstractions for common configuration elements separating configuration structure from configuration data computing instead of enumerating configuration Pkl code lives in modules, a more fancy and general term for files. Evaluating a module produces an in-memory data model that is roughly comparable to a JSON data model. If evaluation completes successfully, the Pkl evaluator converts the data model to an external representation and terminates with the status code zero. Otherwise, the evaluator prints an error message and terminates with a non-zero status code. All Pkl data is immutable. Manipulating a value always returns a new value, leaving the original value unchanged. Immutability eliminates many potential sources of errors. Evaluation of Pkl code is strictly sandboxed. Except for a few well-defined and well-controlled exceptions, Pkl code cannot interact with the outside world. Leaving aside bugs in the language implementation, the worst thing that buggy or malicious Pkl code can do is to consume CPU and memory resources until the evaluator gets killed. Over time, sandboxing will be further strengthened to cover fine-grained CPU and memory boxing. Converting a data model to an external representation is called rendering the model. Pkl ships with renderers for the following data formats: JSON Jsonnet Pcf (a static subset of Pkl) (Java) Properties Property List XML YAML Support for other formats can be added by writing a custom renderer in Pkl or Java. See Module Output and Value Visitor for more information. By design, Pkl code tends to structurally and visually resemble the configuration it generates. This makes the code easier to read and write. Modules can reuse other modules by importing them from local or remote locations. Imports can also be used to split up one large module into multiple smaller ones, increasing maintainability. A configurable security policy helps to keep imports under control. Configuration is structured data. Pkl supports — but does not require — to express this structure as a configuration schema, a set of classes defining configuration properties, their defaults, types, and constraints. Writing and maintaining a configuration schema takes some effort but, in return, provides these benefits: Independent evolution of configuration schema and configuration data, often by different teams (for example service providers and service consumers). Automatic documentation generation. Strong validation of configuration, both during development time and runtime. Statically typed access to configuration from Java and other languages through code generation. Schema-aware development tools, for example REPLs and editors with code completion support. Pkl supports writing templates for objects and entire modules. Templates can be repeatedly turned into concrete configuration by filling in the blanks, and — when necessary — overriding defaults. Sharing template modules over the network can streamline complex configuration tasks for entire teams, organizations, and communities. Everybody needs a configuration solution, but nobody wants to spend a lot of time learning it. To reflect this reality, Pkl has a strong focus on usability. For example, error messages explain causes and possible solutions and object properties maintain definition order to avoid surprises. We hope that this focus on usability will make Pkl accessible to a wide audience of occasional users, while still leaving room for expert users and advanced use cases.","title":"Concepts","component":"main","version":"0.27.1","name":"concepts","url":"/main/current/introduction/concepts.html","titles":[{"text":"Abstraction","hash":"abstraction","id":1},{"text":"Evaluation","hash":"evaluation","id":2},{"text":"Immutability","hash":"immutability","id":3},{"text":"Isolation","hash":"isolation","id":4},{"text":"Rendering","hash":"rendering","id":5},{"text":"Resemblance","hash":"resemblance","id":6},{"text":"Reuse","hash":"reuse","id":7},{"text":"Schema","hash":"schema","id":8},{"text":"Templating","hash":"template","id":9},{"text":"Usability","hash":"usability","id":10}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"Pkl — pronounced Pickle — is a configuration-as-code language with rich validation and tooling.

JSON, YAML, and XML property lists are supported out of the box; renderers for other configuration formats can be developed and shared by anyone.

Synopsis: java -cp -jar pkl-codegen-kotlin.jar [] The absolute or relative URIs of the modules to generate classes for. Relative URIs are resolved against the working directory. --generate-kdoc Default: (flag not set) Flag that indicates to generate Kdoc based on doc comments for Pkl modules, classes, and properties. Common code generator options: --indent Default: \" \" (two spaces) Example: \"\\t\" (one tab) The characters to use for indenting generated source code. -o, --output-dir Default: (not set) Example: generated/ The directory where generated source code is placed. Relative paths are resolved against the working directory. --generate-spring-boot Default: (not set) Flag that indicates to generate config classes for use with Spring Boot. --implement-serializable Default: (not set) Whether to make generated classes implement java.io.Serializable. --rename Default: (none) Example: foo.=com.example.foo. Allows to change default class and package names (derived from Pkl module names) in the generated code. When you need the generated class or package names to be different from the default names derived from the Pkl module names, you can define a rename mapping, where the key is the original Pkl module name prefix, and the value is its replacement. When you do, the generated code’s package declarations, class names, as well as file locations, will be modified according to this mapping. The prefixes are replaced literally, which means that dots at the end are important. If you want to rename packages only, in most cases, you must ensure that you have an ending dot on both sides of a mapping (except for an empty mapping, if you use it), otherwise you may get unexpected results: // Assuming the following arguments: --rename com.foo.=x // Dot on the left only --rename org.bar=y. // Dot on the right only --rename net.baz=z // No dots // The following renames will be made: \"com.foo.bar\" -> \"xbar\" // Target prefix merged into the suffix \"org.bar.baz\" -> \"y..baz\" // Double dot, invalid name \"net.baz.qux\" -> \"z.qux\" // Looks okay, but... \"net.bazqux\" -> \"zqux\" // ...may cut the name in the middle. When computing the appropriate target name, the longest matching prefix is used: // Assuming the following arguments: --rename com.foo.Main=w.Main --rename com.foo.=x. --rename com.=y. --rename =z. // The following renames will be made: com.foo.Main -> w.Main com.foo.bar -> x.bar com.baz.qux -> y.baz.qux org.foo.bar -> z.org.foo.bar Repeat this option to define multiple mappings. Keys can be arbitrary strings, including an empty string. Values must be valid dot-separated fully qualified class name prefixes, possibly terminated by a dot. Common CLI options: --allowed-modules Default: pkl:,file:,modulepath:,https:,repl:,package:,projectpackage: Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which modules can be loaded and evaluated. Patterns are matched against the beginning of module URIs. (File paths have been converted to file: URLs at this stage.) At least one pattern needs to match for a module to be loadable. --allowed-resources Default: env:,prop:,package:,projectpackage: Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which external resources can be read. Patterns are matched against the beginning of resource URIs. At least one pattern needs to match for a resource to be readable. --color Default: auto When to format messages with ANSI color codes. Possible values: \"never\": Never format \"auto\": Format if stdin, stdout, or stderr are connected to a console. \"always\": Always format --cache-dir Default: ~/.pkl/cache Example: /path/to/module/cache/ The cache directory for storing packages. --no-cache Disable caching of packages. -e, --env-var Default: OS environment variables for the current process Example: MY_VAR=myValue Sets an environment variable that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"env:\"). Repeat this option to set multiple environment variables. -h, --help Display help information. --module-path Default: (empty) Example: dir1:zip1.zip:jar1.jar Directories, ZIP archives, or JAR archives to search when resolving modulepath: URIs. Paths are separated by the platform-specific path separator (: on *nix, ; on Windows). Relative paths are resolved against the working directory. -p, --property Default: (none) Example: myProp=myValue Sets an external property that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"prop:\"). Repeat this option to set multiple external properties. --root-dir Default: (none) Example: /some/path Root directory for file: modules and resources. If set, access to file-based modules and resources is restricted to those located under the specified root directory. Any symlinks are resolved before this check is performed. --settings Default: (none) Example: mySettings.pkl File path of the Pkl settings file to use. If not set, ~/.pkl/settings.pkl or defaults specified in the pkl.settings standard library module are used. -t, --timeout Default: (none) Example: 30 Duration, in seconds, after which evaluation of a source module will be timed out. Note that a timeout is treated the same as a program error in that any subsequent source modules will not be evaluated. -v, --version Display version information. -w, --working-dir Base path that relative module paths passed as command-line arguments are resolved against. Defaults to the current working directory. --ca-certificates Default: (none) Example: /some/path/certificates.pem Path to a file containing CA certificates to be used for TLS connections. Setting this option replaces the existing set of CA certificates bundled into the CLI. Certificates need to be X.509 certificates in PEM format. For other methods of configuring certificates, see CA Certificates. --http-proxy Default: (none) Example: http://proxy.example.com:1234 Configures HTTP connections to connect to the provided proxy address. The URI must have scheme http, and may not contain anything other than a host and port. --http-no-proxy Default: (none) Example: example.com,169.254.0.0/16 Comma separated list of hosts to which all connections should bypass the proxy. Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation.

The special float values not a number, positive infinity, and negative infinity are written as: notANumber = NaN positiveInfinity = Infinity negativeInfinity = -Infinity The NaN and Infinity properties are defined in the standard library. Floats support the same comparison and arithmetic operators as integers. Float literals with a fractional part of zero can be safely replaced with integer literals. For example, it is safe to write 1.3 * 42 instead of 1.3 * 42.0. Floats can also include the same underscore separator as integers. For example, 1_000.4_400 is a float whose value is equivalent to 1000.4400. As integers are more convenient to use than floats with a fractional part of zero, we recommend requiring x: Number instead of x: Float in type annotations. To restrict a float to a finite value, use the isFinite type constraint: x: Float(isFinite) To restrict a float’s range, use the isBetween type constraint: x: Float(isBetween(0, 10e6)) A value of type Boolean is either true or false. Apart from the standard logical operators, Boolean has xor and implies methods. res1 = true && false (1) res2 = true || false (2) res3 = !false (3) res4 = true.xor(false) (4) res5 = true.implies(false) (5) 1 logical conjunction (result: false) 2 logical disjunction (result: true) 3 logical negation (result: true) 4 exclusive disjunction (result: true) 5 logical implication (result: false) A value of type String is a sequence of Unicode code points. String literals are enclosed in double quotes: \"Hello, World!\" Except for a few minor differences [1], String literals have the same syntax and semantics as in Swift 5. Learn one of them, know both of them! Inside a string literal, the following character escape sequences have special meaning: \\t - tab \\n - line feed \\r - carriage return \\\" - verbatim quote \\\\ - verbatim backslash Unicode escape sequences have the form \\u{}, where is a hexadecimal number between 0 and 10FFFF: \"\\u{26} \\u{E9} \\u{1F600}\" (1) 1 result: \"& é 😀\" To concatenate strings, use the + (plus) operator, as in \"abc\" + \"def\" + \"ghi\". To embed the result of expression in a string, use \\(): name = \"Dodo\" greeting = \"Hi, \\(name)!\" (1) 1 result: \"Hi, Dodo!\" Before a result is inserted, it is converted to a string: x = 42 str = \"\\(x + 2) plus \\(x * 2) is \\(0x80)\" (1) 1 result: \"44 plus 84 is 128\" To write a string that spans multiple lines, use a multiline string literal: \"\"\" Although the Dodo is extinct, the species will be remembered. \"\"\" Multiline string literals are delimited by three double quotes (\"\"\"). String content and closing delimiter must each start on a new line. The content of a multiline string starts on the first line after the opening quotes and ends on the last line before the closing quotes. Line breaks are included in the string and normalized to \\n. The previous multiline string is equivalent to this single-line string. Notice that there is no leading or trailing whitespace. \"Although the Dodo is extinct,\\nthe species will be remembered.\" String interpolation, character escape sequences, and Unicode escape sequences work the same as for single-line strings: bird = \"Dodo\" message = \"\"\" Although the \\(bird) is extinct, the species will be remembered. \"\"\" Each content line must begin with the same whitespace characters as the line containing the closing delimiter, which is not included in the string. Any further leading whitespace characters are preserved. In other words, line indentation is controlled by indenting lines relative to the closing delimiter. In the following string, lines have no leading whitespace: str = \"\"\" Although the Dodo is extinct, the species will be remembered. \"\"\" In the following string, lines are indented between three and five spaces: str = \"\"\" Although the Dodo is extinct, the species will be remembered. \"\"\" Some strings contain many verbatim backslash (\\) or quote (\") characters. A good example is regular expressions, which make frequent use of backslash characters for escaping. In such cases, using the escape sequences \\\\ and \\\" quickly becomes tedious and hampers readability. Instead, leading/closing string delimiters can be customized to start/end with a pound sign (#). This also affects the escape character, which changes from \\ to \\#. All backslash and quote characters in the following string are interpreted verbatim: #\" \\\\\\\\\\ \"\"\"\"\" \"# Escape sequences and string interpolation still work, and now start with \\#: bird = \"Dodo\" str = #\" \\\\\\\\\\ \\#n \\#u{12AF} \\#(bird) \"\"\"\"\" \"# More generally, string delimiters and escape characters can be customized to contain n pound signs each, for n >= 1. In the following string, n is 2. As a result, the string content is interpreted verbatim: ##\" \\\\\\\\\\ \\#\\#\\# \"\"\"\"\" \"## The String class offers a rich API. Here are just a few examples: strLength = \"dodo\".length (1) reversedStr = \"dodo\".reverse() (2) hasAx = \"dodo\".contains(\"alive\") (3) trimmed = \" dodo \".trim() (4) 1 result: 4 2 result: \"odod\" 3 result: false 4 result: \"dodo\" A value of type Duration has a value component of type Number and a unit component of type String. The unit component is constrained to the units defined in DurationUnit. Durations are constructed with the following Number properties: duration1 = 5.ns // nanoseconds (smallest unit) duration2 = 5.us // microseconds duration3 = 5.ms // milliseconds duration4 = 5.s // seconds duration5 = 5.min // minutes duration6 = 5.h // hours duration7 = 3.d // days (largest unit) A duration can be negative, as in -5.min. It can have a floating point value, as in 5.13.min. The value and unit properties provide access to the duration’s components. Durations support the standard comparison operators: comparison1 = 5.min == 3.s comparison2 = 5.min 3.s comparison4 = 5.min = 3.s Durations support the same arithmetic operators as numbers: res1 = 5.min + 3.s (1) res2 = 5.min - 3.s (2) res3 = 5.min * 3 (3) res4 = 5.min / 3 (4) res5 = 5.min / 3.min (5) res6 = 5.min ~/ 3 (6) res7 = 5.min ~/ 3.min (7) res8 = 5.min % 3 (8) res9 = 5.min ** 3 (9) 1 result: 5.05.min 2 result: 4.95.min 3 result: 15.min 4 result: 1.6666666666666667.min 5 result: 1.6666666666666667 6 result: 1.min 7 result: 1 8 result: 2.min 9 result: 125.min The value component can be an expression: x = 5 xMinutes = x.min (1) y = 3 xySeconds = (x + y).s (2) 1 result: 5.min 2 result: 8.s A value of type DataSize has a value component of type Number and a unit component of type String. The unit component is constrained to the units defined in DataSizeUnit. Data sizes with decimal units (factor 1000) are constructed with the following Number properties: datasize1 = 5.b // bytes (smallest unit) datasize2 = 5.kb // kilobytes datasize3 = 5.mb // megabytes datasize4 = 5.gb // gigabytes datasize5 = 5.tb // terabytes datasize6 = 5.pb // petabytes (largest unit) Data sizes with binary units (factor 1024) are constructed with the following Number properties: datasize1 = 5.b // bytes (smallest unit) datasize2 = 5.kib // kibibytes datasize3 = 5.mib // mebibytes datasize4 = 5.gib // gibibytes datasize5 = 5.tib // tebibytes datasize6 = 5.pib // pebibytes (largest unit) A data size can be negative, as in -5.mb. It can have a floating point value, as in 5.13.mb. The value and unit properties provide access to the data size’s components. Data sizes support the standard comparison operators: comparison1 = 5.mb == 3.kib comparison2 = 5.mb 3.kib comparison4 = 5.mb = 3.kib Data sizes support the same arithmetic operators as numbers: res1 = 5.mb + 3.kib (1) res2 = 5.mb - 3.kib (2) res3 = 5.mb * 3 (3) res4 = 5.mb / 3 (4) res5 = 5.mb / 3.mb (5) res6 = 5.mb ~/ 3 (6) res7 = 5.mb ~/ 3.mb (7) res8 = 5.mb % 3 (8) res9 = 5.mb ** 3 (9) 1 result: 5.003072.mb 2 result: 4.996928.mb 3 result: 15.mb 4 result: 1.6666666666666667.mb 5 result: 1.6666666666666667 6 result: 1.mb 7 result: 1 8 result: 2.mb 9 result: 125.mb The value component can be an expression: x = 5 xMegabytes = x.mb (1) y = 3 xyKibibytes = (x + y).kib (2) 1 result: 5.mb 2 result: 8.kib An object is an ordered collection of values indexed by name. An object’s key-value pairs are called its properties. Property values are lazily evaluated on the first read. Because Pkl’s objects differ in important ways from objects in general-purpose programming languages, and because they are the backbone of most data models, understanding objects is the key to understanding Pkl. Let’s define an object with properties name and extinct: dodo { (1) name = \"Dodo\" (2) extinct = true (3) } (4) 1 Defines a module property named dodo. The open curly brace ({) indicates that the value of this property is an object. 2 Defines an object property named name with string value \"Dodo\". 3 Defines an object property named extinct with boolean value true. 4 The closing curly brace indicates the end of the object definition. To access an object property by name, use dot (.) notation: dodoName = dodo.name dodoIsExtinct = dodo.extinct Objects can be nested: dodo { name = \"Dodo\" taxonomy { (1) `class` = \"Aves\" (2) } } 1 Defines an object property named taxonomy. The open curly brace indicates that its value is another object. 2 The word class is a keyword of Pkl, and needs to be wrapped in backticks (`) to be used as a property. As you probably guessed, the nested property class can be accessed with dodo.taxonomy.class. Like all values, objects are immutable, which is just a fancy (and short!) way to say that their properties never change. So what happens when Dodo moves to a different street? Do we have to construct a new object from scratch? Fortunately, we don’t have to. An object can be amended to form a new object that only differs in selected properties. Here is how this looks: tortoise = (dodo) { (1) name = \"Galápagos tortoise\" taxonomy { (2) `class` = \"Reptilia\" (3) } } 1 Defines a module property named tortoise. Its value is an object that amends dodo. Note that the amended object must be enclosed in parentheses. 2 Object property tortoise.taxonomy amends dodo.taxonomy. 3 Object property tortoise.taxonomy.class overrides dodo.taxonomy.class. As you can see, it is easy to construct a new object that overrides selected properties of an existing object, even if, as in our example, the overridden property is nested inside another object. If this way of constructing new objects from existing objects reminds you of prototypical inheritance, you are spot-on: Pkl objects use prototypical inheritance as known from languages such as JavaScript. But unlike in JavaScript, their prototype chain cannot be directly accessed or even modified. Another difference is that in Pkl, object properties are late-bound. Read on to see what this means. Amends declaration vs. amends expression The defining objects and amending objects sections cover two notations that are both a form of amending; called an amends declaration and an amends expression, respectively. pigeon { (1) name = \"Turtle dove\" extinct = false } parrot = (pigeon) { (2) name = \"Parrot\" } 1 Amends declaration. 2 Amends expression. An amends declaration amends a property of the same name if the property exists within a parent module. Otherwise, an amends declaration implicitly amends Dynamic. Another way to think about an amends declaration is that it is shorthand for assignment. In practical terms, pigeon {} is the same as pigeon = (super.pigeon) {}. Amending object bodies can be chained for both an amends declaration and an amends expression. pigeon { name = \"Common wood pigeon\" } { extinct = false } (1) dodo = (pigeon) { name = \"Dodo\" } { extinct = true } (2) 1 Chained amends declaration. 2 Chained amends expression ((pigeon) { …​ } { …​ } is the amends expression). Let’s move on to Pkl’s secret sauce: the ability to define an object property’s value in terms of another property’s value, and the resulting late binding effect. Here is an example: penguin { eggIncubation = 40.d adultWeightInGrams = eggIncubation.value * 100 (1) } adultWeightInGrams = penguin.adultWeightInGrams 1 result: 4000 We have defined a hypothetical penguin object whose adultWeightInGrams property is defined in terms of the eggIncubation duration. Can you guess what happens when penguin is amended and its eggIncubation overridden? madeUpBird = (penguin) { eggIncubation = 11.d } adultWeightInGrams = madeUpBird.adultWeightInGrams (1) 1 result: 1100 As you can see, madeUpBird's adultWeightInGrams changed along with its eggIncubation. This is what we mean when we say that object properties are late-bound. Spreadsheet Programming A good analogy is that object properties behave like spreadsheet cells. When they are linked, changes to \"downstream\" properties automatically propagate to \"upstream\" properties. The main difference is that editing a spreadsheet cell changes the state of the spreadsheet, whereas \"editing\" a property results in a new object, leaving the original object untouched. It is as if you made a copy of the entire spreadsheet whenever you edited a cell! Late binding of properties is an incredibly useful feature for a configuration language. It is used extensively in Pkl code (especially in templates) and is the key to understanding how Pkl works. Say we have the following object: dodo { name = \"Dodo\" extinct = true } How can property name be removed? The recipe for transforming an object is: Convert the object to a map. Transform the map using Map's rich API. If necessary, convert the map back to an object. Equipped with this knowledge, let’s try to accomplish our objective: dodo .toMap() .remove(\"name\") .toDynamic() The resulting dynamic object is equivalent to dodo, except that it no longer has a name property. Lazy vs. Eager Data Types Converting an object to a map is a transition from a lazy to an eager data type. All of the object’s properties are evaluated and all references between them are resolved. If the map is later converted back to an object, subsequent changes to the object’s properties no longer propagate to (previously) dependent properties. To make these boundaries clear, transitioning between lazy and eager data types always requires an explicit method call, such as toMap() or toDynamic(). Pkl has two kinds of objects: A Dynamic object has no predefined structure.[2] When a dynamic object is amended, not only can existing properties be overridden or amended, but new properties can also be added. So far, we have only used dynamic objects in this chapter. A Typed object has a fixed structure described by a class definition. When a typed object is amended, its properties can be overridden or amended, but new properties cannot be added. In other words, the new object has the same class as the original object. When to Use Typed vs. Dynamic Objects Use typed objects to build schema-backed data models that are validated[3]. This is what most templates do. Use dynamic objects to build schema-less data models that are not validated. Dynamic objects are useful for ad-hoc tasks, tasks that do not justify the effort of writing and maintaining a schema, and for representing data whose structure is unknown. Note that every module is a typed object. Its properties implicitly define a class, and new properties cannot be added when amending the module. A typed object is backed by a class. Let’s look at an example: class Bird { (1) name: String lifespan: Int migratory: Boolean } pigeon = new Bird { (2) name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 migratory = false } 1 Defines a class named Bird with properties name, lifespan and migratory. 2 Defines a module property named pigeon. Its value is a typed object constructed by instantiating class Bird. A type only needs to be stated when the property does not have or inherit a type annotation. Otherwise, amend syntax (pigeon { …​ }) or shorthand instantiation syntax (pigeon = new { …​ }) should be used. Congratulations, you have constructed your first typed object[4]! How does it differ from a dynamic object? The answer is that a typed object has a fixed structure prescribed by its class, which cannot be changed when amending the object: class Bird { (1) name: String lifespan: Int } faultyPigeon = new Bird { name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 hobby = \"singing\" } Evaluating this gives: Cannot find property hobby in object of type repl#Bird. Available properties: lifespan name Class structure is also enforced when instantiating a class. Let’s try to override property name with a value of the wrong type: faultyPigeon2 = new Bird { name = 3.min lifespan = 8 } Evaluating this, also fails: Expected value of type String, but got type Duration. Value: 3.min Typed objects are the fundamental building block for constructing validated data models in Pkl. To dive deeper into this topic, continue with Classes. Converting untyped objects to typed objects When you have a Dynamic that has all the properties (with the right types and meeting all constraints), you can convert it to a Typed by using toTyped(): class Bird { name: String lifespan: Int } pigeon = new Dynamic { (1) name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 }.toTyped(Bird) (2) 1 Instead of a new Bird, pigeon can be defined with a new Dynamic. 2 That Dynamic is then converted to a Bird. A property with the modifier hidden is omitted from the rendered output and object conversions. Hidden properties are also ignored when evaluating equality or hashing (e.g. for Mapping or Map keys). class Bird { name: String lifespan: Int hidden nameAndLifespanInIndex = \"\\(name), \\(lifespan)\" (1) nameSignWidth: UInt = nameAndLifespanInIndex.length (2) } pigeon = new Bird { (3) name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 } pigeonInIndex = pigeon.nameAndLifespanInIndex (4) pigeonDynamic = pigeon.toDynamic() (5) favoritePigeon = (pigeon) { nameAndLifespanInIndex = \"Bettie, \\(lifespan)\" } samePigeon = pigeon == favoritePigeon (6) 1 Properties defined as hidden are accessible on any Bird instance, but not output by default. 2 Non-hidden properties can refer to hidden properties as usual. 3 pigeon is an object with four properties, but is rendered with three properties. 4 Accessing a hidden property from outside the class and object is like any other property. 5 Object conversions omit hidden properties, so the resulting Dynamic has three properties. 6 Objects that differ only in hidden property values are considered equal Invoking Pkl on this file produces the following result. pigeon { name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 nameSignWidth = 9 } pigeonInIndex = \"Pigeon, 8\" pigeonDynamic { name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 nameSignWidth = 9 } favoritePigeon { name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 nameSignWidth = 9 } samePigeon = true A property with the modifier local can only be referenced in the lexical scope of its definition. class Bird { name: String lifespan: Int local separator = \",\" (1) hidden nameAndLifespanInIndex = \"\\(name)\\(separator) \\(lifespan)\" (2) } pigeon = new Bird { name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 } pigeonInIndex = pigeon.nameAndLifespanInIndex (3) pigeonSeparator = pigeon.separator // Error (4) 1 This property can only be accessed from inside this class definition. 2 Non-local properties can refer to the local property as usual. 3 The value of separator occurs in nameAndLifespanInIndex. 4 Pkl does not accept this, as there is no property separator on a Bird instance. Because a local property is added to the lexical scope, but not (observably) to the object, you can add local properties to Listings and Mappings. Import clauses define local properties An import clause defines a local property in the containing module. This means import \"someModule.pkl\" is effectively const local someModule = import(\"someModule.pkl\"). Also, import \"someModule.pkl\" as otherName is effectively const local otherName = import(\"someModule.pkl\"). A property with the fixed modifier cannot be assigned to or amended when defining an object of its class. Bird.pkl fixed laysEggs: Boolean = true fixed birds: Listing = new { \"Pigeon\" \"Hawk\" \"Penguin\" } When amending, assigning to a fixed property is an error. Similarly, it is an error to use an amends declaration on a fixed property: invalid.pkl amends \"Bird.pkl\" laysEggs = false (1) birds { (2) \"Giraffe\" } 1 Error: cannot assign to fixed property laysEggs 2 Error: cannot amend fixed property birds When extending a class and overriding an existing property definition, the fixedness of the overridden property must be preserved. If the property in the parent class is declared fixed, the child property must also be declared fixed. If the property in the parent class is not declared fixed, the child property may not add the fixed modifier. abstract class Bird { fixed canFly: Boolean name: String } class Penguin extends Bird { canFly = false (1) fixed name = \"Penguin\" (2) } 1 Error: missing modifier fixed. 2 Error: modifier fixed cannot be applied to property name. The fixed modifier is useful for defining properties that are meant to be derived from other properties. In the following snippet, the property result is not meant to be assigned to, because it is derived from other properties. class Bird { wingspan: Int weight: Int fixed wingspanWeightRatio: Int = wingspan / weight } Another use-case for fixed is to define properties that are meant to be fixed to a class definition. In the example below, the species of a bird is tied to the class, and therefore is declared fixed. Note that it is possible to define a fixed property without a value, for one of two reasons: The type has a default value that makes an explicit default redundant. The property is meant to be overridden by a child class. abstract class Bird { fixed species: String (1) } class Osprey extends Bird { fixed species: \"Pandion haliaetus\" (2) } 1 No explicit default because the property is overridden by a child class. 2 Overrides the type from String to the string literal type \"Pandion haliaetus\". Assigning an explicit default would be redundant, therefore it is omitted. A property with the const modifier behaves like the fixed modifier, with the additional rule that it cannot reference non-const properties or methods. Bird.pkl const laysEggs: Boolean = true const examples: Listing = new { \"Pigeon\" \"Hawk\" \"Penguin\" } Referencing any non-const property or method is an error. invalid.pkl pigeonName: String = \"Pigeon\" const function birdLifespan(i: Int): Int = (i / 4).toInt() class Bird { name: String lifespan: Int } const bird: Bird = new { name = pigeonName (1) lifespan = birdLifespan(24) (2) } 1 Error: cannot reference non-const property pigeonName from a const property. 2 Allowed: birdLifespan is const. It is okay to reference another value within the same const property. valid.pkl class Bird { lifespan: Int description: String speciesName: \"Bird\" } const bird: Bird = new { lifespan = 8 description = \"species: \\(speciesName), lifespan: \\(lifespan)\" (1) } 1 lifespan is declared within property bird. speciesName resolves to this.speciesName, where this is a value within property bird. Because const members can only reference themselves and other const members, they are not late bound. The const modifier implies that it is also fixed. Therefore, the same rules that apply to fixed also apply to const: A const property cannot be assigned to or amended when defining an object of its class. The const-ness of a property or method must be preserved when it is overridden by a child class. Class, Annotation, and Typealias Scoping In these following scenarios, any reference to a property or method of its enclosing module requires that the referenced member is const: Class body Annotation body Typealiased constrained type invalid2.pkl pigeonName: String = \"Pigeon\" class Bird { name: String = pigeonName (1) } @Deprecated { message = \"Replace with \\(pigeonName)\" } (2) oldPigeonName: String typealias IsPigeonName = String(pigeonName) (3) 1 Error: cannot reference non-const property pigeonName from a class. 2 Error: cannot reference non-const property pigeonName from an annotation. 3 Error: cannot reference non-const property pigeonname from a typealias. This rule exists because classes, annotations, and typealiases are not late bound; it is not possible to change the definition of these members by amending the module where it is defined. Generally, there are two strategies for referencing such properties: Add the const modifier to the referenced property One solution is to add the const modifier to the property being referenced. Birds.pkl -pigeonName: String = \"Pigeon\" +const pigeonName: String = \"Pigeon\" class Bird { name: String = pigeonName } This solution makes sense if pigeonName does not get assigned/amended when amending module Birds.pkl (modules are regular objects that can be amended). Self-import the module Birds.pkl +import \"Birds.pkl\" (1) + pigeonName: String = \"Pigeon\" class Bird { - name: String = pigeonName + name: String = Birds.pigeonName } 1 module Birds imports itself This solution works because an import clause implicitly defines a const local property and amending this module does not affect a self-import. This makes sense if property pigeonName does get assigned/amended when amending module Birds.pkl. A value of type Listing is an ordered, indexed collection of elements. A listing’s elements have zero-based indexes and are lazily evaluated on the first read. Listings combine qualities of lists and objects: Like lists, listings can contain arbitrary elements. Like objects, listings excel at defining and amending nested literal data structures. Like objects, listings can only be directly manipulated through amendment, but converting them to a list (and, if necessary, back to a listing) opens the door to arbitrary transformations. Like object properties, listing elements are evaluated lazily, can be defined in terms of each other, and are late-bound. When to use Listing vs. List When a collection of elements needs to be specified literally, use a listing. When a collection of elements needs to be transformed in a way that cannot be achieved by amending a listing, use a list. If in doubt, use a listing. Templates and schemas should almost always use listings instead of lists. Note that listings can be converted to lists when the need arises. Listings have a literal syntax that is similar to that of objects. Here is a listing with two elements: birds = new Listing { (1) new { (2) name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seed\" } new { (3) name = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Berries\" } } 1 Defines a module property named birds with a value of type Listing. A type only needs to be stated when the property does not have or inherit a type annotation. Otherwise, amend syntax (birds { …​ }) or shorthand instantiation syntax (birds = new { …​ }) should be used. 2 Defines a listing element of type Dynamic. 3 Defines another listing element of type Dynamic. The order of definitions is relevant. To access an element by index, use the [] (subscript) operator: firstBirdName = birds[0].name (1) secondBirdDiet = birds[1].diet (2) 1 result: \"Pigeon\" 2 result: \"Berries\" Listings can contain arbitrary types of elements: listing = new Listing { \"Pigeon\" (1) 3.min (2) new Listing { (3) \"Barn owl\" } } 1 Defines a listing element of type String. 2 Defines a listing element of type Duration. 3 Defines a listing element of type Listing. Listings can have local properties: listing = new Listing { local pigeon = \"Pigeon\" (1) pigeon (2) \"A \" + pigeon + \" is a bird\" (3) } 1 Defines a local property with the value \"Pigeon\". Local properties can have a type annotation, as in pigeon: String = \"Pigeon\". 2 Defines a listing element that references the local property. 3 Defines another listing element that references the local property. Let’s say we have the following listing: birds = new Listing { new { name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" } new { name = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Berries\" } } To add, override, or amend elements of this listing, amend the listing itself: birds2 = (birds) { (1) new { (2) name = \"Barn owl\" diet = \"Mice\" } [0] { (3) diet = \"Worms\" } [1] = new { (4) name = \"Albatross\" diet = \"Fish\" } } 1 Defines a module property named birds2. Its value is a listing that amends birds. 2 Defines a listing element of type Dynamic. 3 Amends the listing element at index 0 (whose name is \"Pigeon\") and overrides property diet. 4 Overrides the listing element at index 1 (whose name is \"Parrot\") with an entirely new dynamic object. A listing element can be defined in terms of another element. To reference the element at index , use this[]: birds = new Listing { new { (1) name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" } (this[0]) { (2) name = \"Parrot\" } } 1 Defines a listing element of type Dynamic. 2 Defines a listing element that amends the element at index 0 and overrides name. Listing elements are late-bound: newBirds = (birds) { (1) [0] { diet = \"Worms\" } } secondBirdDiet = newBirds[1].diet (2) 1 Amends listing birds and overrides property diet of element 0 (whose name is \"Pigeon\"`) to have the value \"Worms\". 2 Because element 1 is defined in terms of element 0, its diet property also changes to \"Worms\". Say we have the following listing: birds = new Listing { new { name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" } new { name = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Berries\" } } How can the order of elements be reversed programmatically? The recipe for transforming a listing is: Convert the listing to a list. Transform the list using List's rich API. If necessary, convert the list back to a listing. Often, transformations happen in a converter of a value renderer. Because most value renderers treat lists the same as listings, it is often not necessary to convert back to a listing. Equipped with this knowledge, let’s try to accomplish our objective: reversedbirds = birds .toList() .reverse() .toListing() result now contains the same elements as birds, but in reverse order. Lazy vs. Eager Data Types Converting a listing to a list is a transition from a lazy to an eager data type. All of the listing’s elements are evaluated and all references between them are resolved. If the list is later converted back to a listing, subsequent changes to the listing’s elements no longer propagate to (previously) dependent elements. To make these boundaries clear, transitioning between lazy and eager data types always requires an explicit method call, such as toList() or toListing(). Listings can have a default element: birds = new Listing { default { (1) lifespan = 8 } new { (2) name = \"Pigeon\" (3) } new { (4) name = \"Parrot\" lifespan = 20 (5) } } 1 Amends the default element and sets property lifespan. 2 Defines a new listing element that implicitly amends the default element. 3 Defines a new property called name. Property lifespan is inherited from the default element. 4 Defines a new listing element that implicitly amends the default element. 5 Overrides the default for property lifespan. default is a hidden (that is, not rendered) property defined in class Listing. If birds had a type annotation, a suitable default element would be inferred from its type parameter. If, as in our example, no type annotation is provided or inherited, the default element is the empty Dynamic object. Like regular listing elements, the default element is late-bound. As a result, defaults can be changed retroactively: birds2 = (birds) { default { lifespan = 8 diet = \"Seeds\" } } Because both of birds's elements amend the default element, changing the default element also changes them. An equivalent literal definition of birds2 would look as follows: birds2 = new Listing { new { name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 diet = \"Seeds\" } new { name = \"Parrot\" lifespan = 20 diet = \"Berries\" } } Note that Parrot kept its diet because its prior self defined it explicitly, overriding any default. If you are interested in the technical underpinnings of default elements (and not afraid of dragons!), continue with Function Amending. To declare the type of a property that is intended to hold a listing, use: x: Listing This declaration has the following effects: x is initialized with an empty listing. If ElementType has a default value, that value becomes the listing’s default element. The first time x is read, its value is checked to have type Listing. the listing’s elements are checked to have the type ElementType. Here is an example: class Bird { name: String lifespan: Int } birds: Listing Because the default value for type Bird is new Bird {}, that value becomes the listing’s default element. Let’s go ahead and populate birds: birds { new { name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 } new { name = \"Parrot\" lifespan = 20 } } Thanks to birds's default element, which was inferred from its type, it is not necessary to state the type of each list element (new Bird { …​ }, new Bird { …​ }, etc.). To constrain a listing to distinct elements, use Listing's isDistinct property: class Bird { name: String lifespan: Int } birds: Listing(isDistinct) This is as close as Pkl’s late-bound data types (objects, listings, and mappings) get to a Set. To demand distinct names instead of distinct Bird objects, use isDistinctBy(): birds: Listing(isDistinctBy((it) -> it.name)) A value of type Mapping is an ordered collection of values indexed by key. Most of what has been said about listings also applies to mappings. Nevertheless, this section is written to stand on its own. A mapping’s key-value pairs are called its entries. Keys are eagerly evaluated; values are lazily evaluated on the first read. Mappings combine qualities of maps and objects: Like maps, mappings can contain arbitrary key-value pairs. Like objects, mappings excel at defining and amending nested literal data structures. Like objects, mappings can only be directly manipulated through amendment, but converting them to a map (and, if necessary, back to a mapping) opens the door to arbitrary transformations. Like object properties, a mapping’s values (but not its keys) are evaluated lazily, can be defined in terms of each other, and are late-bound. When to use Mapping vs. Map When key-value style data needs to be specified literally, use a mapping. When key-value style data needs to be transformed in a way that cannot be achieved by amending a mapping, use a map. If in doubt, use a mapping. Templates and schemas should almost always use mappings instead of maps. Note that mappings can be converted to maps when the need arises. Mappings have the same literal syntax as objects, except that keys enclosed in [] take the place of property names. Here is a mapping with two entries: birds = new Mapping { (1) [\"Pigeon\"] { (2) lifespan = 8 diet = \"Seeds\" } [\"Parrot\"] { (3) lifespan = 20 diet = \"Berries\" } } 1 Defines a module property named birds with a value of type Mapping. A type only needs to be stated when the property does not have or inherit a type annotation. Otherwise, amend syntax (birds { …​ }) or shorthand instantiation syntax (birds = new { …​ }) should be used. 2 Defines a mapping entry with the key \"Pigeon\" and a value of type Dynamic. 3 Defines a mapping entry with the key \"Parrot\" and a value of type Dynamic. To access a value by key, use the [] (subscript) operator: pigeon = birds[\"Pigeon\"] parrot = birds[\"Parrot\"] Mappings can contain arbitrary types of values: mapping = new Mapping { [\"number\"] = 42 [\"list\"] = List(\"Pigeon\", \"Parrot\") [\"nested mapping\"] { [\"Pigeon\"] { lifespan = 20 diet = \"Seeds\" } } } Although string keys are most common, mappings can contain arbitrary types of keys: mapping = new Mapping { [3.min] = 42 [new Dynamic { name = \"Pigeon\" }] = \"abc\" } Keys can be computed: mapping = new Mapping { [\"Pigeon\".reverse()] = 42 } Mappings can have local properties: mapping = new Mapping { local parrot = \"Parrot\" (1) [\"Pigeon\"] { (2) friend = parrot } } 1 Defines a local property name parrot with the value \"Parrot\". Local properties can have a type annotation, as in parrot: String = \"Parrot\". 2 Defines a mapping entry whose value references parrot. The local property is visible to values but not keys. Let’s say we have the following mapping: birds = new Mapping { [\"Pigeon\"] { lifespan = 8 diet = \"Seeds\" } [\"Parrot\"] { lifespan = 20 diet = \"Berries\" } } To add, override, or amend entries of this mapping, amend the mapping: birds2 = (birds) { (1) [\"Barn owl\"] { (2) lifespan = 15 diet = \"Mice\" } [\"Pigeon\"] { (3) diet = \"Seeds\" } [\"Parrot\"] = new { (4) lifespan = 20 diet = \"Berries\" } } 1 Defines a module property named birds2. Its value is a mapping that amends birds. 2 Defines a mapping entry with the key \"Barn owl\" and a value of type Dynamic. 3 Amends mapping entry \"Pigeon\" and overrides property diet. 4 Overrides mapping entry \"Parrot\" with an entirely new value of type Dynamic. A mapping entry’s value can be defined in terms of another entry’s value. To reference the value with key , use this[]: birds = new Mapping { [\"Pigeon\"] { (1) lifespan = 8 diet = \"Seeds\" } [\"Parrot\"] = (this[\"Pigeon\"]) { (2) lifespan = 20 } } 1 Defines a mapping entry with the key \"Pigeon\" and a value of type Dynamic. 2 Defines a mapping entry with the key \"Parrot\" and a value that amends \"Pigeon\". Mapping values are late-bound: birds2 = (birds) { (1) [\"Pigeon\"] { diet = \"Seeds\" } } parrotDiet = birds2[\"Parrot\"].diet (2) 1 Amends mapping birds and overrides \"Pigeon\"'s diet property to have value \"Seeds\". 2 Because \"Parrot\" is defined in terms of \"Pigeon\", its diet property also changes to \"Seeds\". Say we have the following mapping: birds = new Mapping { [\"Pigeon\"] { lifespan = 8 diet = \"Seeds\" } [\"Parrot\"] = (this[\"Pigeon\"]) { lifespan = 20 } } How can birds's keys be reversed programmatically? The recipe for transforming a mapping is: Convert the mapping to a map. Transform the map using Map's rich API. If necessary, convert the map back to a mapping. Often, transformations happen in a converter of a value renderer. As most value renderers treat maps the same as mappings, it is often not necessary to convert back to a mapping. Equipped with this knowledge, let’s try to accomplish our objective: result = birds .toMap() .mapKeys((key, value) -> key.reverse()) .toMapping() result contains the same values as birds, but its keys have changed to \"noegiP\" and \"torraP\". Lazy vs. Eager Data Types Converting a mapping to a map is a transition from a lazy to an eager data type. All of the mapping’s values are evaluated and all references between them are resolved. (Mapping keys are eagerly evaluated.) If the map is later converted back to a mapping, changes to the mapping’s values no longer propagate to (previously) dependent values. To make these boundaries clear, transitioning between lazy and eager data types always requires an explicit method call, such as toMap() or toMapping(). Mappings can have a default value: birds = new Mapping { default { (1) lifespan = 8 } [\"Pigeon\"] { (2) diet = \"Seeds\" (3) } [\"Parrot\"] { (4) lifespan = 20 (5) } } 1 Amends the default value and sets property lifespan. 2 Defines a mapping entry with the key \"Pigeon\" that implicitly amends the default value. 3 Defines a new property called diet. Property lifespan is inherited from the default value. 4 Defines a mapping entry with the key \"Parrot\" that implicitly amends the default value. 5 Overrides the default for property lifespan. default is a hidden (that is, not rendered) property defined in class Mapping. If birds had a type annotation, a suitable default value would be inferred from its second type parameter. If, as in our example, no type annotation is provided or inherited, the default value is the empty Dynamic object. Like regular mapping values, the default value is late-bound. As a result, defaults can be changed retroactively: birds2 = (birds) { default { lifespan = 8 diet = \"Seeds\" } } Because both of birds's mapping values amend the default value, changing the default value also changes them. An equivalent literal definition of birds2 would look as follows: birds2 = new Mapping { [\"Pigeon\"] { lifespan = 8 diet = \"Seeds\" } [\"Parrot\"] { lifespan = 20 diet = \"Berries\" } } Note that Parrot kept its lifespan because its prior self defined it explicitly, overriding any default. If you are interested in the technical underpinnings of default values, continue with Function Amending. To declare the type of a property that is intended to hold a mapping, use: x: Mapping This declaration has the following effects: x is initialized with an empty mapping. If ValueType has a default value, that value becomes the mapping’s default value. The first time x is read, its value is checked to have type Mapping. the mapping’s keys are checked to have type KeyType. the mapping’s values are checked to have type ValueType. Here is an example: class Bird { lifespan: Int } birds: Mapping Because the default value for type Bird is new Bird {}, that value becomes the mapping’s default value. Let’s go ahead and populate birds: birds { [\"Pigeon\"] { lifespan = 8 } [\"Parrot\"] { lifespan = 20 } } Thanks to birds's default value, which was inferred from its type, it is not necessary to state the type of each mapping value ([\"Pigeon\"] = new Bird { …​ }, [\"Parrot\"] = new Bird { …​ }, etc.). Classes are arranged in a single inheritance hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy sits class Any; at the bottom, type nothing. Classes contain properties and methods, which can be local to their declaring scope. Properties can also be hidden from rendering. class Bird { name: String hidden taxonomy: Taxonomy } class Taxonomy { `species`: String } pigeon: Bird = new { name = \"Common wood pigeon\" taxonomy { species = \"Columba palumbus\" } } pigeonClass = pigeon.getClass() Declaration of new class instances will fail when property names are misspelled: // Detects the spelling mistake parrot = new Bird { namw = \"Parrot\" } Pkl supports single inheritance with a Java(Script)-like syntax. abstract class Bird { name: String } class ParentBird extends Bird { kids: List } pigeon: ParentBird = new { name = \"Old Pigeon\" kids = List(\"Pigeon Jr.\", \"Teen Pigeon\") } Pkl methods can be defined on classes and modules using the function keyword. Methods may access properties of their containing type. Submodules and subclasses can override them. Like Java and most other object-oriented languages, Pkl uses single dispatch — methods are dynamically dispatched based on the receiver’s runtime type. class Bird { name: String function greet(bird: Bird): String = \"Hello, \\(bird.name)!\" (1) } function greetPigeon(bird: Bird): String = bird.greet(pigeon) (2) pigeon: Bird = new { name = \"Pigeon\" } parrot: Bird = new { name = \"Parrot\" } greeting1 = pigeon.greet(parrot) (3) greeting2 = greetPigeon(parrot) (4) 1 Instance method of class Bird. 2 Module method. 3 Call instance method on pigeon. 4 Call module method (on this). Methods do not support named parameters or default parameter values. The Class-as-a-function pattern may be a suitable replacement. In most cases, methods without parameters should not be defined. Instead, use fixed properties on the module or class. Modules are the unit of loading, executing, and sharing Pkl code. Every file containing Pkl code is a module. By convention, module files have a .pkl extension. Modules have a Module Name and are loaded from a Module URI. At runtime, modules are represented as objects of type Module. The precise runtime type of a module is a subclass of Module containing the module’s property and method definitions. Like class members, module members may have type annotations, which are validated at runtime: timeout: Duration(isPositive) = 5.ms function greet(name: String): String = \"Hello, \\(name)!\" Because modules are regular objects, they can be assigned to properties and passed to and returned from methods. Modules can be imported by other modules. In analogy to objects, modules can serve as templates for other modules through amending. In analogy to classes, modules can be extended to add additional module members. Modules may declare their name by way of a module clause, which consists of the keyword module followed by a qualified name: /// My bird module. module com.animals.Birds A module clause must come first in a module. Its doc comment, if present, holds the module’s overall documentation. In the absence of a module clause, a module’s name is inferred from the module URI from which the module was first loaded. For example, the inferred name for a module first loaded from https://example.com/pkl/bird.pkl is bird. Module names do not affect evaluation but are used in diagnostic messages and Pkldoc. In particular, they are the first component (everything before the hash sign) of fully qualified member names such as pkl.base#Int. Modules shared with other parties should declare a qualified module name, which is more unique and stable than an inferred name. Modules are loaded from module URIs. By default, the following URI types are available for import: Example: file:///path/to/my_module.pkl Represents a module located on a file system. Example: https://example.com/my_module.pkl Represents a module imported via an HTTP(S) GET request. Modules loaded from HTTP(S) URIs are only cached until the pkl command exits or the Evaluator object is closed. Example: modulepath:/path/to/my_module.pkl Module path URIs are resolved relative to the module path, a search path for modules similar to Java’s class path (see the --module-path CLI option). For example, given the module path /dir1:/zip1.zip:/jar1.jar, module modulepath:/path/to/my_module.pkl will be searched for in the following locations: /dir1/path/to/my_module.pkl /path/to/my_module.pkl within /zip1.zip /path/to/my_module.pkl within /jar1.jar When evaluating Pkl code from Java, modulepath:/path/to/my_module.pkl corresponds to class path location path/to/my_module.pkl. In a typical Java project, this corresponds to file path src/main/resources/path/to/my_module.pkl or src/test/resources/path/to/my_module.pkl. Example: package://example.com/mypackage@1.0.0#/my_module.pkl Represent a module within a package. A package is a shareable archive of modules and resources that are published to the internet. To import package://example.com/mypackage@1.0.0#/my_module.pkl, Pkl follows these steps: Make an HTTPS GET request to https://example.com/mypackage@1.0.0 to retrieve the package’s metadata. From the package metadata, download the referenced zip archive, and validate its checksum. Resolve path /my_module.pkl within the package’s zip archive. A package asset URI has the following form: 'package://' '@' '#' Optionally, the SHA-256 checksum of the package can also be specified: 'package://' '@' '::sha256:' '#' Packages can be managed as dependencies within a project. For more details, consult the project section of the language reference. Example: pkl:math Standard library modules are named pkl. and have module URIs of the form pkl:. For example, module pkl.math has module URI pkl:math. See the API Docs for the complete list of standard library modules. Relative module URIs are interpreted relative to the URI of the enclosing module. For example, a module with URI modulepath:/animals/birds/pigeon.pkl can import modulepath:/animals/birds/parrot.pkl with import \"parrot.pkl\" or import \"/animals/birds/parrot.pkl\". Paths on Windows Relative paths use the / character as the directory separator on all platforms, including Windows. Paths that contain drive letters (e.g. C:) must be declared as an absolute file URI, for example: import \"file:///C:/path/to/my/module.pkl\". Otherwise, they are interpreted as a URI scheme. When importing a relative directory or file that starts with @, the import string must be prefixed with ./. Otherwise, this syntax will be interpreted as dependency notation. Example: @birds/bird.pkl Dependency notation URIs represent a path within a project or package dependency. For example, import @birds/bird.pkl represents path /bird.pkl in a dependency named \"birds\". A dependency is either a remote package or a local project dependency. Pkl embedders can register additional module loaders that recognize other types of module URIs. Module URIs can be evaluated directly: $ pkl eval path/to/mymodule.pkl $ pkl eval file:///path/to/my_module.pkl $ pkl eval https://apple.com/path/to/mymodule.pkl $ pkl eval --module-path=/pkl-modules modulepath:/path/to/my_module.pkl $ pkl eval pkl:math To simplify referencing ancestor modules in a hierarchical module structure, relative file and module path URIs may start with .../, a generalization of ../. Module URI .../foo/bar/baz.pkl resolves to the first existing module among ../foo/bar/baz.pkl, ../../foo/bar/baz.pkl, ../../../foo/bar/baz.pkl, and so on. Furthermore, module URI ... is equivalent to .../. Using triple-dot module URIs never resolve to the current module. For example, a module at path foo/bar.pkl that references module URI .../foo/bar.pkl does not resolve to itself. Recall how an object is amended: pigeon { name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" } parrot = (pigeon) { (1) name = \"Parrot\" (2) } 1 Object parrot amends object pigeon, inheriting all of its members. 2 parrot overrides name. Amending a module works in the same way, except that the syntax differs slightly: pigeon.pkl name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" parrot.pkl amends \"pigeon.pkl\" (1) name = \"Parrot\" (2) 1 Module parrot amends module pigeon, inheriting all of its members. 2 parrot overrides name. A module is amended by way of an amends clause, which consists of the keyword amends followed by the module URI of the module to amend. An amends clause comes after the module clause (if present) and before any import clauses: parrot.pkl module parrot amends \"pigeon.pkl\" import \"other.pkl\" name = \"Parrot\" At most one amends clause is permitted. A module cannot have both an amends clause and an extends clause. An amending module has the same type (that is, module class) as the module it amends. As a consequence, it cannot define new properties, methods, or classes, unless they are declared as local. In our example, this means that module parrot can only define (and thus override) the property name. Spelling mistakes such as namw are caught immediately, rather than accidentally defining a new property. Amending is used to fill in template modules: The template module defines which properties exist, their types, and what module output is desired (for example JSON indented with two spaces). The amending module fills in property values as required, relying on the structure, defaults and validation provided by the template module. The amending module is evaluated to produce the final result. Template modules are often provided by third parties and served over HTTPS. Recall how a class is extended: PigeonAndParrot.pkl open class Pigeon { (1) name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" } class Parrot extends Pigeon { (2) name = \"Parrot\" (3) diet = \"Berries\" (4) extinct = false (5) function say() = \"Pkl is great!\" (6) } 1 Class Pigeon is declared as open for extension. 2 Class Parrot extends Pigeon, inheriting all of its members. 3 Parrot overrides name. 4 Parrot overrides diet. 5 Parrot defines a new property named extinct. 6 Parrot defines a new function named say. Extending a module works in the same way, except that the syntax differs slightly: pigeon.pkl open module pigeon (1) name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" 1 Module pigeon is declared as open for extension. parrot.pkl extends \"pigeon.pkl\" (1) name = \"Parrot\" (2) diet = \"Berries\" (3) extinct = false (4) function say() = \"Pkl is great!\" (5) 1 Module parrot extends module pigeon, inheriting all of its members. 2 parrot overrides name. 3 parrot overrides diet. 4 parrot defines a new property named extinct. 5 parrot defines a new function named say. A module is extended by way of an extends clause, which consists of the keyword extends followed by the module URI of the module to extend. The extends clause comes after the module clause (if present) and before any import clauses. Only modules declared as open can be extended. parrot.pkl module parrot extends \"pigeon.pkl\" import \"other.pkl\" name = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Berries\" extinct = false function say() = \"Pkl is great!\" At most one extends clause is permitted. A module cannot have both an amends clause and an extends clause. Extending a module implicitly defines a new module class that extends the original module’s class. A module import makes the imported module accessible to the importing module. A module is imported by way of either an import clause, or an import expression. An import clause consists of the keyword import followed by the module URI of the module to import. An import clause comes after module, amends and extends clauses (if present), and before the module body: parrot.pkl module parrot amends \"pigeon.pkl\" import \"module1.pkl\" import \"module2.pkl\" name = \"Parrot\" Multiple import clauses are permitted. A module import implicitly defines a new const local property through which the imported module can be accessed. (Remember that modules are regular objects.) The name of this property, called import name, is constructed from the module URI as follows: Strip the URI scheme, including the colon (:). Strip everything up to and including the last forward slash (/). Strip any trailing .pkl file extension. Here are some examples: Local file import import \"modules/pigeon.pkl\" // relative to current module name = pigeon.name HTTPS import import \"https://mycompany.com/modules/pigeon.pkl\" name = pigeon.name Standard library import import \"pkl:math\" pi = math.Pi Package import import \"package://example.com/birds@1.0.0#/sparrow.pkl\" name = sparrow.name Because its members are automatically visible in every module, the pkl:base module is typically not imported. Occasionally, the default import name for a module may not be convenient or appropriate: If not a valid identifier, the import name needs to be enclosed in backticks on each use, for example, `my-module`.someMember. The import name may clash with other names in the importing module. In such a case, a different import name can be chosen: parrot.pkl import \"pigeon.pkl\" as piggy name = \"Parrot\" diet = piggy.diet What makes a good module file name? When creating a new module, especially one intended for import into other modules, try to choose a module file name that makes a good import name: short Less than six characters, not counting the .pkl file extension, is a good rule of thumb. valid identifier Stick to alphanumeric characters. Use an underscore (_) instead of a hyphen (-) as a name separator. descriptive An import name should make sense on its own and when used in qualified member names. An import expression consists of the keyword import, followed by a module URI wrapped in parentheses: module birds pigeon = import(\"pigeon.pkl\") parrot = import(\"parrot.pkl\") Unlike import clauses, import expressions only import a value, and do not import a type. A type is a name that can be used in type positions, for example, as a type annotation. Multiple modules may be imported at once with import*. When importing multiple modules, a glob pattern is used to match against existing resources. A globbed import evaluates to a Mapping, where keys are the expanded form of the glob and values are import expressions on each individual module. Globbed imports can be expressed as either a clause or as an expression. When expressed as a clause, they follow the same naming rules as a normal import clause: they introduce a local property equal to the last path segment without the .pkl extension. A globbed import clause cannot be used as a type. import* \"birds/*.pkl\" as allBirds (1) import* \"reptiles/*.pkl\" (2) birds = import*(\"birds/*.pkl\") (3) 1 Globbed import clause 2 Globbed import clause without an explicit name (will import the name *) 3 Globbed import expression Assuming that a file system contains these files: . ├── birds/ │ ├── pigeon.pkl │ ├── parrot.pkl │ └── falcon.pkl └── index.pkl The following two snippets are logically identical: index.pkl birds = import*(\"birds/*.pkl\") index.pkl birds = new Mapping { [\"birds/pigeon.pkl\"] = import(\"birds/pigeon.pkl\") [\"birds/parrot.pkl\"] = import(\"birds/parrot.pkl\") [\"birds/falcon.pkl\"] = import(\"birds/falcon.pkl\") } By default, only the file and package schemes are globbable. Globbing another scheme will cause Pkl to throw. Pkl can be extended to provide custom globbable schemes through the ModuleKey SPI. When globbing within packages, only the asset path (the fragment section) is globbable. Otherwise, characters are interpreted verbatim, and not treated as glob wildcards. For details on how glob patterns work, refer to Glob Patterns in the Advanced Topics section. When globbing files, symbolic links are not followed. Additionally, the . and .. entries are skipped. This behavior is similar to the behavior of Bash with shopt -s dotglob enabled. When attempting to directly evaluate a module, as in pkl eval myModule.pkl, the following security checks are performed: The module URI is checked against the module allowlist (--allowed-modules). The module allowlist is a comma-separated list of regular expressions. For access to be granted, at least one regular expression must match a prefix of the module URI. For example, the allowlist file:,https: grants access to any module whose URI starts with file: or https:. When a module attempts to load another module (via amends, extends, or imports), the following security checks are performed: The target module URI is checked against the module allowlist (--allowed-modules). The source and target modules' trust levels are determined and compared. For access to be granted, the source module’s trust level must be higher than or equal to the target module’s trust level. By default, there are five trust levels, listed from highest to lowest: repl: modules (code evaluated in the REPL) file: modules modulepath: modules All other modules (for example https:) pkl: modules (standard library) For example, this means that file: modules can import https: modules, but not the other way around. If a module URI is resolved in multiple steps, all URIs are subject to the above security checks. An example of this is an HTTPS URL that results in a redirect. Pkl embedders can further customize security checks. By default, the output of evaluating a module is the entire module rendered as Pcf. There are two ways to change this behavior: Outside the language, by using the --format CLI option or the outputFormat Gradle task property. Inside the language, by configuring a module’s output property. Given the following module: config.pkl a = 10 b { c = 20 } pkl eval config.pkl, which is shorthand for pkl eval --format pcf config.pkl, renders the module as Pcf: a = 10 b { c = 20 } pkl eval --format yaml config.pkl renders the module as YAML: a: 10 b: c: 20 Likewise, pkl eval --format json config.pkl renders the module as JSON. Now let’s do the same — and more — inside the language. Modules have an output property that controls what the module’s output is and how that output is rendered. To control what the output is, set the output.value property: a = 10 b { c = 20 } output { value = b // defaults to `outer`, which is the entire module } This produces: c = 20 To control how the output is rendered, set the output.renderer property: a = 10 b { c = 20 } output { renderer = new YamlRenderer {} } The standard library provides these renderers: JsonRenderer jsonnet.Renderer PcfRenderer PListRenderer PropertiesRenderer protobuf.Renderer xml.Renderer YamlRenderer To render a format that is not yet supported, you can implement your own renderer by extending the class ValueRenderer. The standard library renderers can be configured with value converters, which influence how particular values are rendered. For example, since YAML does not have a standard way to represent data sizes, a plain YamlRenderer cannot render DataSize values. However, we can teach it to: quota { memory = 100.mb disk = 20.gb } output { renderer = new YamlRenderer { converters { [DataSize] = (size) -> \"\\(size.value) \\(size.unit)\" } } } This produces: quota: memory: 100 MB disk: 20 GB In addition to type based converters, renderers also support path based converters: output { renderer = new YamlRenderer { converters { [\"quota.memory\"] = (size) -> \"\\(size.value) \\(size.unit)\" [\"quota.disk\"] = (size) -> \"\\(size.value) \\(size.unit)\" } } } For more on path-based converters, see PcfRenderer.converters. Sometimes it is useful to directly compute the final module output, bypassing output.value and output.converters. To do so, set the output.text property to a String value: output { // defaults to `renderer.render(value)` text = \"this is the final output\".toUpperCase() } This produces: THIS IS THE FINAL OUTPUT It is sometimes desirable for a single module to produce multiple output files. This is possible by configuring a module’s output.files property and specifying the --multiple-file-output-path (or -m for short) CLI option. Here is an example that produces a JSON and a YAML file: birds.pkl pigeon { name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" } parrot { name = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Seeds\" } output { files { [\"birds/pigeon.json\"] { value = pigeon renderer = new JsonRenderer {} } [\"birds/parrot.yaml\"] { value = parrot renderer = new YamlRenderer {} } } } Running pkl eval -m output/ birds.pkl produces the following output files: output/birds/pigeon.json { \"name\": \"Pigeon\", \"diet\": \"Seeds\" } output/birds/parrot.yaml name: Parrot diet: Berries Within output.files, a key determines a file’s path relative to --multiple-file-output-path, and a value determines the file’s contents. If a file’s path resolves to a location outside --multiple-file-output-path, evaluation fails with an error. Non-existing parent directories are created. A value within output.files can be another module’s output. With this, a module can aggregate the outputs of multiple other modules. Here is an example: pigeon.pkl name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" output { renderer = new JsonRenderer {} } parrot.pkl name = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Seeds\" output { renderer = new YamlRenderer {} } birds.pkl import \"pigeon.pkl\" import \"parrot.pkl\" output { files { [\"birds/pigeon.json\"] = pigeon.output [\"birds/parrot.yaml\"] = parrot.output } } When aggregating module outputs, the appropriate file extensions can be obtained programmatically: birds.pkl import \"pigeon.pkl\" import \"parrot.pkl\" output { files { [\"birds/pigeon.\\(pigeon.output.renderer.extension)\"] = pigeon.output [\"birds/parrot.\\(parrot.output.renderer.extension)\"] = parrot.output } } The keyword null indicates the absence of a value. null is an instance of Null, a direct subclass of Any. The !! (non-null) operator asserts that its operand is non-null. Here are some examples: name = \"Pigeon\" nameNonNull = name!! (1) name2 = null name2NonNull = name2!! (2) 1 result: \"Pigeon\" 2 result: Error: Expected a non-null value, but got null. The ?? (null coalescing) operator fills in a default for a null value. value ?? default The above expression evaluates to value if value is non-null, and to default otherwise. Here are some examples: name = \"Pigeon\" nameOrParrot = name ?? \"Parrot\" (1) name2 = null name2OrParrot = name2 ?? \"Parrot\" (2) 1 result: \"Pigeon\" 2 result: \"Parrot\" Default non-null behavior Many languages allow null for (almost) every type, but Pkl does not. Any type can be extended to include null by appending ? to the type. For example, parrot: Bird will always be non-null, but pigeon: Bird? could be null - and is by default, if pigeon is never amended. This means if you try to coalesce a (non-nullable) typed variable, the result is always that variable’s value. As per our example parrot ?? pigeon == parrot always holds, but pigeon ?? parrot could either be pigeon or parrot, depending on whether pigeon was ever amended with a non-null value. The ?. (null propagation) operator provides null-safe access to a member whose receiver may be null. value?.member The above expression evaluates to value.member if value is non-null, and to null otherwise. Here are some examples: name = \"Pigeon\" nameLength = name?.length (1) nameUpper = name?.toUpperCase() (2) name2 = null name2Length = name2?.length (3) name2Upper = name2?.toUpperCase() (4) 1 result: 6 2 result: \"PIGEON\" 3 result: null 4 result: null The ?. operator is often combined with ??: name = null nameLength = name?.length ?? 0 (1) 1 result: 0 The ifNonNull() method is a generalization of the null propagation operator. name.ifNonNull((it) -> doSomethingWith(it)) The above expression evaluates to doSomethingWith(name) if name is non-null, and to null otherwise. Here are some examples: name = \"Pigeon\" nameWithTitle = name.ifNonNull((it) -> \"Dr.\" + it) (1) name2 = null name2WithTitle = name2.ifNonNull((it) -> \"Dr.\" + it) (2) 1 result: \"Dr. Pigeon\" 2 result: null To express that a property can have any type except Null, use the NonNull type alias: x: NonNull An if expression serves the same role as the ternary operator (? :) in other languages. Every if expression must have an else branch. num = if (2 + 2 == 5) 1984 else 42 (1) 1 result: 42 Pkl programs can read external resources, such as environment variables or text files. To read a resource, use a read expression: path = read(\"env:PATH\") By default, the following resource URI schemes are supported: env: Reads an environment variable. Result type is String. prop: Reads an external property set via the -p name=value CLI option. Result type is String. file: Reads a file from the file system. Result type is Resource. http(s): Reads an HTTP(S) resource. Result type is Resource. modulepath: Reads a resource from the module path (--module-path) or JVM class path. Result type is Resource. See Module Path URI for further information. package: Reads a resource from a package. Result type is Resource. See Package asset URI: for further information. Relative resource URIs are resolved against the enclosing module’s URI. Resources are cached in memory on the first read. Therefore, subsequent reads are guaranteed to return the same result. If a resource does not exist or cannot be read, read() fails with an error. To recover from the absence of a resource, use read?() instead, which returns null for absent resources: port = read?(\"env:PORT\")?.toInt() ?? 1234 Multiple resources may be read at the same time with read*(). When reading multiple resources, a glob pattern is used to match against existing resources. A globbed read returns a Mapping, where the keys are the expanded form of the glob, and values are read expressions on each individual resource. Assuming that a file system contains these files: . ├── birds/ │ ├── pigeon.pkl │ ├── parrot.pkl │ └── falcon.pkl └── index.pkl The following two snippets are logically identical: index.pkl birdFiles = read*(\"birds/*.pkl\") index.pkl birdFiles = new Mapping { [\"birds/pigeon.pkl\"] = read(\"birds/pigeon.pkl\") [\"birds/parrot.pkl\"] = read(\"birds/parrot.pkl\") [\"birds/falcon.pkl\"] = read(\"birds/falcon.pkl\") } By default, the following schemes support globbing: modulepath file env prop Globbing other resources results in an error. For details on how glob patterns work, reference Glob Patterns in the Advanced Topics section. When globbing files, symbolic links are not followed. Additionally, the . and .. entries are skipped. This behavior is similar to the behavior of Bash with shopt -s dotglob enabled. The env and prop schemes are considered opaque, as they do not have traditional hierarchical elements like a host, path, or query string. While globbing is traditionally viewed as a way to match elements in a file system, a glob pattern is simply a way to match strings. Thus, environment variables and external properties can be globbed, where their names get matched according to the rules described by the glob pattern. To match all values within these schemes, use the ** wildcard. This has the effect of matching names that contain a forward slash too (/). For example, the expression read*(\"env:**\") will evaluate to a Mapping of all environment variables. When Pkl is embedded within another runtime, it can be extended to read other kinds of resources. When embedded into a JVM application, new resources may be read by implementing the ResourceReader SPI. When Pkl is embedded within Swift, new resources may be read by implementing the ResourceReader interface. When Pkl is embedded within Go, new resources may be read by implementing the ResourceReader interface. When attempting to read a resource, the resource URI is checked against the resource allowlist (--allowed-resources). In embedded mode, the allowlist is configured via an evaluator’s SecurityManager. The resource allowlist is a comma-separated list of regular expressions. For access to be granted, at least one regular expression must match a prefix of the resource URI. For example, the allowlist file:,https: grants access to any resource whose URI starts with file: or https:. By design, errors are fatal in Pkl — there is no way to recover from them. To raise an error, use a throw expression: myValue = throw(\"You won't be able to recover from this one!\") (1) 1 myValue never receives a value because the program exits. The error message is printed to the console and the program exits. In embedded mode, a PklException is thrown. When debugging Pkl code, it can be useful to print the value of an expression. To do so, use a trace expression: num1 = 42 num2 = 16 res = trace(num1 * num2) Tracing an expression does not affect its result, but prints both its source code and result on standard error: pkl: TRACE: num1 * num2 = 672 (at file:///some/module.pkl, line 42) This section discusses language features that are generally more relevant to template and library authors than template consumers. Meaning of new Let Expressions Type Tests Type Casts Lists Sets Maps Regular Expressions Type Aliases Type Annotations Anonymous Functions Amending Null Values When Generators For Generators Spread Syntax Member Predicates ([[…​]]) Glob Patterns Doc Comments Name Resolution Grammar Definition Reserved Keywords Blank Identifiers Projects External Readers Objects in Pkl always amends some value. The new keyword is a special case of amending where a contextual value is amended. In Pkl, there are two forms of new objects: new with explicit type information, for example, new Foo {}. new without type information, for example, new {}. To understand instantiation cases without explicit parent or type information, it’s important to first understand implicit default values. When a property is declared in a module or class but is not provided an explicit default value, the property’s default value becomes the type’s default value. Similarly, when Listing and Mapping types are declared with explicit type arguments for their element or value, their default property amends that declared type. When Listing and Mapping types are declared without type arguments, their default property amends an empty Dynamic object. Some types, including Pair and primitives like String, Number, and Boolean have no default value; attempting to render such a property results in the error \"Tried to read property but its value is undefined\". class Bird { name: String = \"polly\" } bird: Bird (1) birdListing: Listing (2) birdMapping: Mapping (3) 1 Without an explicit default value, this property has default value new Bird { name = \"polly\" } 2 With an explicit element type argument, this property’s default value is equivalent to new Listing { default = (_) → new Bird { name = \"polly\" } } 3 With an explicit value type argument, this property’s default value is equivalent to new Mapping { default = (_) → new Bird { name = \"polly\" } } Instantiating an object with new results in a value that amends the specified type’s default value. Notably, creating a Listing element or assigning a Mapping entry value with an explicitly typed new ignores the object’s default value. class Bird { /// The name of the bird name: String /// Whether this is a bird of prey or not. isPredatory: Boolean? } newProperty = new Bird { (1) name = \"Warbler\" } someListing = new Listing { default { isPredatory = true } new Bird { (2) name = \"Sand Piper\" } } someMapping = new Mapping { default { isPredatory = true } [\"Penguin\"] = new Bird { (3) name = \"Penguin\" } } 1 Assigning a new explicitly-typed value to a property. 2 Adding an new explicitly-typed Listing element. The value will not have property isPredatory = true as the default property of the Listing is not used. 3 Assigning a new explicitly-typed value to a Mapping entry. The value will not have property isPredatory = true as the default property of the Mapping is not used. When using the implicitly typed new invocation, there is no explicit parent value to amend. In these cases, Pkl infers the amend operation’s parent value based on context: When assigning to a declared property, the property’s default value is amended (including null). If there is no type associated with the property, an empty Dynamic object is amended. When assigning to an entry (e.g. a Mapping member) or element (e.g. a Listing member), the enclosing object’s default property is applied to the corresponding index or key, respectively, to produce the value to be amended. In other cases, evaluation fails with the error message \"Cannot tell which parent to amend\". The type annotation of a method parameter is not used for inference. In this case, the argument’s type should be specified explicitly. class Bird { name: String function listHatchlings(items: Listing): Listing = new { for (item in items) { \"\\(name):\\(item)\" } } } typedProperty: Bird = new { (1) name = \"Swift\" } untypedProperty = new { (2) hello = \"world\" } typedListing: Listing = new { new { (3) name = \"Kite\" } } untypedListing: Listing = new { new { (4) hello = \"there\" } } typedMapping: Mapping = new { default { entryKey -> name = entryKey } [\"Saltmarsh Sparrow\"] = new { (5) name = \"Sharp-tailed Sparrow\" } } amendedMapping = (typedMapping) { [\"Saltmarsh Sparrow\"] = new {} (6) } class Aviary { birds: Listing = new { new { name = \"Osprey\" } } } aviary: Aviary = new { birds = new { (7) new { name = \"Kiwi\" } } } swiftHatchlings = typedProperty.listHatchlings(new { \"Poppy\"; \"Chirpy\" }) (8) 1 Assignment to a property with an explicitly declared type, amending new Bird {}. 2 Assignment to an undeclared property in module context, amending new Dynamic {}. 3 Listing element creation, amending implicit default, new Bird {}. 4 Listing element creation, amending implicit default, new Dynamic {}. 5 Mapping value assignment, amdending the result of applying default to \"Saltmarsh Sparrow\", new Bird { name = \"Saltmarsh Sparrow\" }. 6 Mapping value assignment replacing the parent’s entry, amending the result of applying default to \"Saltmarsh Sparrow\", new Bird { name = \"Saltmarsh Sparrow\" }. 7 Admending the property default value new Listing { new Bird { name = \"Osprey\" } }; the result contains both birds. 8 Error: Cannot tell which parent to amend. A let expression is Pkl’s version of an (immutable) local variable. Its syntax is: let ( = ) A let expression is evaluated as follows: is bound to , itself an expression. is evaluated, which can refer to by its (this is the point). The result of becomes the result of the overall expression. Here is an example: birdDiets = let (diets = List(\"Seeds\", \"Berries\", \"Mice\")) List(diets[2], diets[0]) (1) 1 result: birdDiets = List(\"Mice\", \"Seeds\") let expressions serve two purposes: They introduce a human-friendly name for a potentially complex expression. They evaluate a potentially expensive expression that is used in multiple places only once. let expressions can have type annotations: birdDiets = let (diets: List = List(\"Seeds\", \"Berries\", \"Mice\")) diets[2] + diets[0] (1) 1 result: birdDiets = List(\"Mice\", \"Seeds\") let expressions can be stacked: birdDiets = let (birds = List(\"Pigeon\", \"Barn owl\", \"Parrot\")) let (diet = List(\"Seeds\", \"Mice\", \"Berries\")) birds.zip(diet) (1) 1 result: birdDiets = List(Pair(\"Pigeon\", \"Seeds\"), Pair(\"Barn owl\", \"Mice\"), Pair(\"Parrot\", \"Berries\")) To test if a value conforms to a type, use the is operator. All the following tests hold: test1 = 42 is Int test2 = 42 is Number test3 = 42 is Any test4 = !(42 is String) open class Base class Derived extends Base base = new Base {} test5 = base is Base test6 = base is Any test7 = !(base is Derived) derived = new Derived {} test8 = derived is Derived test9 = derived is Base test10 = derived is Any A value can be tested against any type, not just a class: test1 = email is String(contains(\"@\")) (1) test2 = map is Map (2) test3 = name is \"Pigeon\"|\"Barn owl\"|\"Parrot\" (3) 1 email is tested for being a string that contains a @ sign 2 map is tested for being a map from Int to Base values 3 name is tested for being one of \"Pigeon\", \"Barn owl\", or \"Parrot\" The as (type cast) operator performs a runtime type check on its operand. If the type check succeeds, the operand is returned as-is; otherwise, an error is thrown. birds { new { name = \"Pigeon\" } new { name = \"Barn owl\" } } names = birds.toList().map((it) -> it.name) as List Although type casts are never mandatory in Pkl, they occasionally help humans and tools better understand an expression’s type. A value of type List is an ordered, indexed collection of elements. A list’s elements have zero-based indexes and are eagerly evaluated. When to use List vs. Listing When a collection of elements needs to be specified literally, use a listing. When a collection of elements needs to be transformed in a way that cannot be achieved by amending a listing, use a list. If in doubt, use a listing. Templates and schemas should almost always use listings instead of lists. Note that listings can be converted to lists when the need arises. Lists are constructed with the List() method[5]: list1 = List() (1) list2 = List(1, 2, 3) (2) list3 = List(1, \"x\", 5.min, List(1, 2, 3)) (3) 1 result: empty list 2 result: list of length 3 3 result: heterogeneous list whose last element is another list To concatenate lists, use the + operator: List(1, 2) + List(3, 4) + List(5) To access a list element by index, use the [] (subscript) operator: list = List(1, 2, 3, 4) listElement = list[2] (1) 1 result: 3 Class List offers a rich API. Here are just a few examples: list = List(1, 2, 3, 4) res1 = list.contains(3) (1) res2 = list.first (2) res3 = list.rest (3) res4 = list.reverse() (4) res5 = list.drop(1).take(2) (5) res6 = list.map((n) -> n * 3) (6) 1 result: true 2 result: 1 3 result: List(2, 3, 4) 4 result: List(4, 3, 2, 1) 5 result: List(2, 3) 6 result: List(3, 6, 9, 12) A value of type Set is an ordered collection of unique elements. A set’s elements are eagerly evaluated. Sets are constructed with the Set() method[5]: res1 = Set() (1) res2 = Set(1, 2, 3) (2) res3 = Set(1, 2, 3, 1) (3) res4 = Set(1, \"x\", 5.min, List(1, 2, 3)) (4) 1 result: empty set 2 result: set of length 3 3 result: same set of length 3 4 result: heterogeneous set that contains a list as its last element To compute the union of sets, use the + operator: Set(1, 2) + Set(2, 3) + Set(5, 3) (1) 1 result: Set(1, 2, 3, 5) Class Set offers a rich API. Here are just a few examples: set = Set(1, 2, 3, 4) res1 = set.contains(3) (1) res2 = set.drop(1).take(2) (2) res3 = set.map((n) -> n * 3) (3) res4 = set.intersect(Set(3, 9, 2)) (4) 1 result: true 2 result: Set(2, 3) 3 result: Set(3, 6, 9, 12) 4 result: Set(3, 2) A value of type Map is an ordered collection of values indexed by key. A map’s key-value pairs are called its entries. Keys and values are eagerly evaluated. When to use Map vs. Mapping When key-value style data needs to be specified literally, use a mapping. When key-value style data needs to be transformed in ways that cannot be achieved by amending a mapping, use a map. If in doubt, use a mapping. Templates and schemas should almost always use mappings instead of maps. (Note that mappings can be converted to maps when the need arises.) Maps are constructed by passing alternating keys and values to the Map() method[5]: map1 = Map() (1) map2 = Map(1, \"one\", 2, \"two\", 3, \"three\") (2) map3 = Map(1, \"x\", 2, 5.min, 3, Map(1, 2)) (3) 1 result: empty map 2 result: set of length 3 3 result: heterogeneous map whose last value is another map Any Pkl value can be used as a map key: Map(new Dynamic { name = \"Pigeon\" }, 10.gb) To merge maps, use the + operator: combinedMaps = Map(1, \"one\") + Map(2, \"two\", 1, \"three\") + Map(4, \"four\") (1) 1 result: Map(1, \"three\", 2, \"two\", 4, \"four\") To access a value by key, use the [] (subscript) operator: map = Map(\"Pigeon\", 5.gb, \"Parrot\", 10.gb) parrotValue = map[\"Parrot\"] (1) 1 result: 10.gb Class Map offers a rich API. Here are just a few examples: map = Map(\"Pigeon\", 5.gb, \"Parrot\", 10.gb) res1 = map.containsKey(\"Parrot\") (1) res2 = map.containsValue(8.gb) (2) res3 = map.isEmpty (3) res4 = map.length (4) res5 = map.getOrNull(\"Falcon\") (5) 1 result: true 2 result: false 3 result: false 4 result: 2 5 result: null A value of type Regex is a regular expression with the same syntax and semantics as a Java regular expression. Regular expressions are constructed with the Regex() method: emailRegex = Regex(#\"([\\w\\.]+)@([\\w\\.]+)\"#) Notice the use of custom string delimiters #\" and \"#, which change the string’s escape character from \\ to \\#. As a consequence, the regular expression’s backslash escape character no longer requires escaping. To test if a string fully matches a regular expression, use String.matches(): \"pigeon@example.com\".matches(emailRegex) Many String methods accept either a String or Regex argument. Here is an example: res1 = \"Pigeon\".contains(\"pigeon@example.com\") res2 = \"Pigeon\".contains(emailRegex) To find all matches of a regex in a string, use Regex.findMatchesIn(). The result is a list of RegexMatch objects containing details about each match: matches = emailRegex.findMatchesIn(\"pigeon@example.com / falcon@example.com / parrot@example.com\") list1 = matches.drop(1).map((it) -> it.start) (1) list2 = matches.drop(1).map((it) -> it.value) (2) list3 = matches.drop(1).map((it) -> it.groups[1].value) (3) 1 result: List(0, 19, 40) (the entire match, matches[0], was dropped) 2 result: List(\"pigeon@example.com\", \"falcon@example.com\", \"parrot@example.com\") 3 result: List(\"pigeon, falcon, parrot\") A type alias introduces a new name for a (potentially complicated) type: typealias EmailAddress = String(matches(Regex(#\".+@.+\"#))) Once a type alias has been defined, it can be used in type annotations: email: EmailAddress = \"pigeon@example.com\" emailList: List = List(\"pigeon@example.com\", \"parrot@example.com\") New type aliases can be defined in terms of existing ones: typealias EmailList = List emailList: EmailList = List(\"pigeon@example.com\", \"parrot@example.com\") Type aliases can have type parameters: typealias StringMap = Map map: StringMap = Map(\"Pigeon\", 42, \"Falcon\", 21) Code generators have different strategies for dealing with type aliases: the Java code generator inlines them the Kotlin code generator turns them into Kotlin type aliases. Type aliases for unions of String Literal Types are turned into enum classes by both code generators. The pkl.base module defines the following type aliases: Int8 (-128 to 127) Int16 (-32,768 to 32,767) Int32 (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) UInt8 (0 to 255) UInt16 (0 to 65,535) UInt32 (0 to 4,294,967,295) UInt (0 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) Uri (any String value) Note that UInt has the same maximum value as Int, half of what would normally be expected. The main purpose of the provided integer aliases is to enforce the range of an integer: port: UInt16 = -1 This gives: Type constraint isBetween(0, 65535) violated. Value: -1 To restrict a number to a custom range, use the isBetween method: port: Int(isBetween(0, 1023)) = 443 Remember that numbers are always instances of Int or Float. Type aliases such as UInt16 only check that numbers are within a certain range. The Java and Kotlin code generators map predefined type aliases to the most suitable Java and Kotlin types. For example, UInt8 is mapped to java.lang.Byte and kotlin.Byte, and Uri is mapped to java.net.URI. Property and method definitions may optionally contain type annotations. Type annotations serve the following purposes: Documentation + Type annotations help to document data models. They are included in any generated documentation. Validation + Type annotations are validated at runtime. Defaults + Type-annotated properties have Default Values. Code Generation + Type annotations enable statically typed access to configuration data through code generation. Tooling + Type annotations enable advanced tooling features such as code completion in editors. Any class can be used as a type: class Bird { name: String (1) } bird: Bird (2) 1 Declares an instance property of type String. 2 Declares a module property of type Bird. Any module import can be used as type: bird.pkl name: String lifespan: Int birds.pkl import \"bird.pkl\" pigeon: bird (1) parrot: bird (1) 1 Guaranteed to amend bird.pkl. As a special case, the module keyword denotes the enclosing module’s type: bird.pkl name: String lifespan: Int friends: Listing pigeon.pkl amends \"bird.pkl\" name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 friends { import(\"falcon.pkl\") (1) } 1 falcon.pkl (not shown here) is guaranteed to amend bird.pkl. Any type alias can be used as a type: typealias EmailAddress = String(contains(\"@\")) email: EmailAddress (1) emailList: List (2) 1 equivalent to email: String(contains(\"@\")) for type checking purposes 2 equivalent to emailList: List for type checking purposes Class types such as Bird (see above) do not admit null values. To turn them into nullable types, append a question mark (?): bird: Bird = null (1) bird2: Bird? = null (2) 1 throws Type mismatch: Expected a value of type Bird, but got null 2 succeeds The only class types that admit null values despite not ending in ? are Any and Null. (Null is not very useful as a type because it only admits null values.) Any? and Null? are equivalent to Any and Null, respectively. In some languages, nullable types are also known as optional types. The following class types are generic types: Pair Collection Listing List Mapping Set Map Function0 Function1 Function2 Function3 Function4 Function5 Class A generic type has constituent types written in angle brackets (<>): pair: Pair (1) coll: Collection (2) list: List (3) set: Set (4) map: Map (5) mapping: Mapping (6) 1 a pair String and Bird as types for the first and second element, respectively 2 a collection of Bird elements 3 a list of Bird elements 4 a set of Bird elements 5 a map with String keys and Bird values 6 a mapping of String keys and Bird values Omitting the constituent types is equivalent to declaring them as unknown: pair: Pair // equivalent to `Pair` coll: Collection // equivalent to `Collection` list: List // equivalent to `List` set: Set // equivalent to `Set` map: Map // equivalent to `Map` mapping: Mapping // equivalent to `Mapping` The unknown type is both a top and a bottom type. When a static type analyzer encounters an expression of unknown type, it backs off and trusts the user that they know what they are doing. A value of type A | B, read \"A or B\", is either a value of type A or a value of type B. class Bird { name: String } bird1: String|Bird = \"Pigeon\" bird2: String|Bird = new Bird { name = \"Pigeon\" } More complex union types can be formed: foo: List|Bird Union types have no implicit default values, but an explicit type can be chosen using a * marker: foo: \"a\"|\"b\" // undefined. Will throw an error if not amended bar: \"a\"|*\"b\" // default value will be taken from type \"b\" baz: \"a\"|\"b\" = \"a\" // explicit value is given qux: String|*Int // default taken from Int, but Int has no default. Will throw if not amended Union types often come in handy when writing schemas for legacy JSON or YAML files. A string literal type admits a single string value: diet: \"Seeds\" While occasionally useful on their own, string literal types are often combined with Union Types to form enumerated types: diet: \"Seeds\"|\"Berries\"|\"Insects\" To reuse an enumerated type, introduce a type alias: typealias Diet = \"Seeds\"|\"Berries\"|\"Insects\" diet: Diet The Java and Kotlin code generators turn type aliases for enumerated types into enum classes. The nothing type is the bottom type of Pkl’s type system, the counterpart of top type Any. The bottom type is assignment-compatible with every other type, and no other type is assignment-compatible with it. Being assignment-compatible with every other type may sound too good to be true, but there is a catch — the nothing type has no values! Despite being a lonely type, nothing has practical applications. For example, it is used in the standard library’s TODO() method: function TODO(): nothing = throw(\"TODO\") A nothing return type indicates that a method never returns normally but always throws an error. The unknown type [6] is nothing's even stranger cousin: it is both a top and bottom type! This makes unknown assignment-compatible with every other type, and every other type assignment-compatible with unknown. When a static type analyzer encounters a value of unknown type, it backs off and trusts the code’s author to know what they are doing — for example, whether a method called on the value exists. In the spirit of progressive disclosure, type annotations are optional in Pkl. Omitting a type annotation is equivalent to specifying the type unknown: lifespan = 42 (1) map: Map (2) function say(name) = name (3) 1 shorthand for lifespan: unknown = 42 (As a dynamically typed language, Pkl does not try to statically infer types.) 2 shorthand for map: Map = Map() 3 shorthand for function say(name: unknown): unknown = name Type-annotated properties have implicit \"empty\" default values depending on their type: class Bird coll: Collection // = List() (1) list: List // = List() (2) set: Set // = Set() (3) map: Map // = Map() (4) listing: Listing // = new Listing { default = (index) -> new Bird {} } (5) mapping: Mapping // = new Mapping { default = (key) -> new Bird {} } (6) obj: Bird // = new Bird {} (7) nullable: Bird? // = Null(new Bird {}) (8) union: *Bird|String // = new Bird {} (9) stringLiteral: \"Pigeon\" // = \"Pigeon\" (10) nullish: Null // = null (11) 1 Properties of type Collection default to the empty list. 2 Properties of type List default to the empty list. 3 Properties of type Set default to the empty set. 4 Properties of type Map default to the empty map. 5 Properties of type Listing default to an empty listing whose default element is the default for X. 6 Properties of type Mapping default to an empty mapping whose default value is the default for Y. 7 Properties of non-external class type X default to new X {}. 8 Properties of type X? default to Null(x) where x is the default for X. 9 Properties with a union type have no default value. By prefixing one of the types in a union with a *, the default of that type is chosen as the default for the union. 10 Properties with a string literal type default to the type’s only value. 11 Properties of type Null default to null. See Amending Null Values for further information. Properties of the following types do not have implicit default values: abstract classes, including Any and NotNull Union types, unless an explicit default is given by prefixing one of the types with *. external (built-in) classes, including: String Boolean Int Float Duration DataSize Pair Regex Accessing a property that neither has an (implicit or explicit) default value nor has been overridden throws an error: name: String A type may be followed by a comma-separated list of type constraints enclosed in round brackets (()). A type constraint is a boolean expression that must hold for the annotated element. Type constraints enable advanced runtime validation that goes beyond the capabilities of static type checking. class Bird { name: String(length >= 3) // (1) parent: String(this != name) // (2) } pigeon: Bird = new { name = \"Pigeon\" parent = \"Pigeon Sr.\" (3) } 1 Restricts name to have at least three characters. 2 The name of the bird (this) should not be the same as the name of the parent. 3 Note how parent is different from name. If they were the same, we would be thrown a constraint error. In the following example, we define a Bird with a name of only two characters. pigeon: Bird = new { // fails the constraint because [name] is less than 3 characters name = \"Pi\" } Boolean expressions are convenient for ad-hoc type constraints. Alternatively, type constraints can be given as lambda expressions accepting a single argument, namely the value to be validated. This allows for the abstraction and reuse of type constraints. class Project { local emailAddress = (str) -> str.matches(Regex(#\".+@.+\"#)) email: String(emailAddress) } project: Project = new { email = \"projectPigeon@example.com\" } project: Project = new { // fails the constraint because `\"projectPigeon-example.com\"` doesn't match the regular expression. email = \"projectPigeon-example.com\" } A composite type can have type constraints for the overall type, its constituent types, or both. class Project { local emailAddress = (str) -> str.matches(Regex(#\".+@.+\"#)) // constrain the nullable type's element type type: String(contains(\"source\"))? // constrain the map type and its key/value types contacts: Map(length expr (1) (param) -> expr (2) (param1, param2, ..., paramN) -> expr (3) 1 Zero-parameter lambda expression 2 Single-parameter lambda expression 3 Multi-parameter lambda expression Here is an example: (n) -> n * 3 This anonymous function accepts a parameter named n, multiplies it by 3, and returns the result. Anonymous functions are values of type Function, more specifically Function0, Function1, Function2, Function3, Function4, or Function5. They cannot have more than five parameters. To invoke an anonymous function, call its apply method: ((n) -> n * 3).apply(4) // 12 Many standard library methods accept anonymous functions: List(1, 2, 3).map((n) -> n * 3) // List(3, 6, 9) Anonymous functions can be assigned to properties, thereby giving them a name: add = (a, b) -> a + b added = add.apply(2, 3) If an anonymous function is not intended to be passed as value, it is customary to declare a method instead: function add(a, b) = a + b added = add(2, 3) An anonymous function’s parameters can have type annotations: (a: Number, b: Number) -> a + b Applying this function to arguments not of type Number results in an error. Anonymous functions are closures: They can access members defined in a lexically enclosing scope, even after leaving that scope: a = 42 addToA = (b: Number) -> a + b list = List(1, 2, 3).map(addToA) // List(43, 44, 45) Single-parameter anonymous functions can also be applied with the |> (pipe) operator, which expects a function argument to the left and an anonymous function to the right. The pipe operator works especially well for chaining multiple functions: mul3 = (n) -> n * 3 add2 = (n) -> n + 2 num = 4 |> mul3 |> add2 |> mul3 (1) 1 result: 42 Like methods, anonymous functions can be recursive: factor = (n: Number(isPositive)) -> if (n { diet = \"Seeds\" } For properties with type annotation, the shorthand new { …​ } syntax can be used: withDietTyped: Mixin = new { diet = \"Seeds\" } To apply a mixin, use the |> (pipe) operator: pigeon { name = \"Pigeon\" } pigeonWithDiet = pigeon |> withDiet barnOwl { name = \"Barn owl\" } barnOwlWithDiet = barnOwl |> withDiet withDiet can be generalized by turning it into a factory method for mixins: function withDiet(_diet: String) = new Mixin { diet = _diet } seedPigeon = pigeon |> withDiet(\"Seeds\") MiceBarnOwl = barnOwl |> withDiet(\"Mice\") Mixins can themselves be modified with function amending. An anonymous function that returns an object can be amended with the same syntax as that object. The result is a new function that accepts the same number of parameters as the original function, applies the original function to them, and amends the returned object. Function amending is a special form of function composition. Thanks to function amending, Listing.default and Mapping.default can be treated as if they were objects, only gradually revealing their true (single-parameter function) nature: birds = new Mapping { default { (1) diet = \"Seeds\" } [\"Pigeon\"] { (2) lifespan = 8 } } 1 Amends the default function, which returns a default mapping value given a mapping key, and sets property diet. 2 Implicitly applies the amended default function and amends the returned object with property lifespan. The result is a mapping whose entry \"Pigeon\" has both diet and lifespan set. When amending an anonymous function, it is possible to access its parameters by declaring a comma-separated, arrow (→) terminated parameter list after the opening curly brace ({). Once again, this is especially useful to configure a listing’s or mapping’s default function: birds = new Mapping { default { key -> (1) name = key } [\"Pigeon\"] {} (2) [\"Barn owl\"] {} (3) } 1 Amends the default function and sets the name property to the mapping entry’s key. To access the default function’s key parameter, it is declared with key →. (Any other parameter name could be chosen, but key is customary for default functions.) 2 Defines a mapping entry with key \"Pigeon\" 3 Defines a mapping entry with key \"Barn owl\" The result is a mapping with two entries \"Pigeon\" and \"Barn owl\" whose name properties are set to their keys. Function amending can also be used to refine mixins. It’s time to lift a secret: The predefined null value is just one of the potentially many values of type Null. First, here are the technical facts: Null values are constructed with pkl.base#Null(). Null(x) constructs a null value that is equivalent to x when amended. In other words, Null(x) { …​ } is equivalent to x { …​ }. All null values are equal according to ==. We say that Null(x) is a \"null value with default x\". But what is it useful for? Null values with default are used to define properties that are null (\"switched off\") by default but have a default value once amended (\"switched on\"). Here is an example: template.pkl // we don't have a pet yet, but already know that it is going to be a bird pet = Null(new Dynamic { animal = \"bird\" }) amends \"template.pkl\" // We got a pet, let's fill in its name pet { name = \"Parry the Parrot\" } A null value can be switched on without adding or overriding a property: amends \"template.pkl\" // We do not need to name anything if we have no pet yet pet {} The predefined null value is defined as Null(new Dynamic {}). In other words, amending null is equivalent to amending Dynamic {} (the empty dynamic object): pet = null pet { name = \"Parry the Parrot\" } In most cases, the Null() method is not used directly. Instead, it is used under the hood to create implicit defaults for properties with nullable type: template.pkl class Pet { name: String animal: String = \"bird\" } // defaults to `Null(Pet {})` pet: Pet? amends \"template.pkl\" pet { name = \"Perry the Parrot\" } The general rule is: A property with nullable type X? defaults to Null(x) if type X has default value x, and to null if X has no default value. when generators conditionally generate object members. They come in two variants: when () { } when () { } else { } The following code conditionally generates properties hobby and idol: isSinger = true parrot { lifespan = 20 when (isSinger) { hobby = \"singing\" idol = \"Frank Sinatra\" } } when generators can have an else part: isSinger = false parrot { lifespan = 20 when (isSinger) { hobby = \"singing\" idol = \"Aretha Franklin\" } else { hobby = \"whistling\" idol = \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\" } } Besides properties, when generators can generate elements and entries: abilities { \"chirping\" when (isSinger) { \"singing\" (1) } \"whistling\" } abilitiesByBird { [\"Barn owl\"] = \"hooing\" when (isSinger) { [\"Parrot\"] = \"singing\" (2) } [\"Parrot\"] = \"whistling\" } 1 conditional element 2 conditional entry for generators generate object members in a loop. They come in two variants: for ( in ) { } for (, in ) { } The following code generates a birds object containing three elements. Each element is an object with properties name and lifespan. names = List(\"Pigeon\", \"Barn owl\", \"Parrot\") birds { for (_name in names) { new { name = _name lifespan = 42 } } } The following code generates a birdsByName object containing three entries. Each entry is an object with properties name and lifespan keyed by name. namesAndLifespans = Map(\"Pigeon\", 8, \"Barn owl\", 15, \"Parrot\", 20) birdsByName { for (_name, _lifespan in namesAndLifespans) { [_name] { name = _name lifespan = _lifespan } } } The following types are iterable: Type Key Value IntSeq element index (Int) element value (Int) List element index (Int) element value (Element) Set element index (Int) element value (Element) Map entry key (Key) entry value (Value) Listing element index (Int) element value (Element) Mapping entry key (Key) entry value (Value) Dynamic element index (Int) entry key property name (String) element value entry value property value Indices are zero-based. Note that for generators can generate elements and entries but not properties.[7] Spread syntax generates object members from an iterable value. There are two variants of spread syntax, a non-nullable variant and a nullable variant. ... ...? Spreading an Object (one of Dynamic, Listing and Mapping) will unpack all of its members into the enclosing object [8]. Entries become entries, elements become elements, and properties become properties. entries1 { [\"Pigeon\"] = \"Piggy the Pigeon\" [\"Barn owl\"] = \"Barney the Barn owl\" } entries2 { ...entries1 (1) } elements1 { 1; 2 } elements2 { ...elements1 (2) } properties1 { name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" } properties2 { ...properties1 (3) } 1 Spreads entries [\"Pigeon\"] = \"Piggy the Pigeon\" and [\"Barn owl\"] = \"Barney the Barn owl\" 2 Spreads elements 1 and 2 3 Spreads properties name = \"Pigeon\" and diet = \"Seeds\" Spreading all other iterable types generates members determined by the iterable. The following table describes how different iterables turn into object members: Iterable type Member type Map Entry List Element Set Element IntSeq Element These types can only be spread into enclosing objects that support that member type. For example, a List can be spread into a Listing, but cannot be spread into a Mapping. In some ways, spread syntax can be thought of as a shorthand for a for generator. One key difference is that spread syntax can generate properties, which is not possible with a for generator. Look out for duplicate key conflicts when using spreads. Spreading entries or properties may cause conflicts due to matched existing key definitions. In the following code snippet, \"Pigeon\" is declared twice in the newPets object, and thus is an error. oldPets { [\"Pigeon\"] = \"Piggy the Pigeon\" [\"Parrot\"] = \"Perry the Parrot\" } newPets { ...oldPets [\"Pigeon\"] = \"Toby the Pigeon\" (1) } 1 Error: Duplicate definition of member \"Pigeon\". A non-nullable spread (...) will error if the value being spread is null. In contrast, a nullable spread (...?) is syntactic sugar for wrapping a spread in a when. The following two snippets are logically identical. result { ...?myValue } result { when (myValue != null) { ...myValue } } Occasionally it is useful to configure all object members matching a predicate. This is especially true when configuring elements, which—unlike entries—cannot be accessed by key: environmentVariables { (1) new { name = \"PIGEON\"; value = \"pigeon-value\" } new { name = \"PARROT\"; value = \"parrot-value\" } new { name = \"BARN OWL\"; value = \"barn-owl-value\" } } updated = (environmentVariables) { [[name == \"PARROT\"]] { (2) value = \"new-value\" (3) } } 1 a listing of environment variables 2 amend element(s) whose name equals \"PARROT\" (name is shorthand for this.name) 3 update value to \"new-value\" The predicate, enclosed in double brackets (\\[[…​]]), is matched against each member of the enclosing object. Within the predicate, this refers to the member that the predicate is matched against. Matching members are amended ({ …​ }) or overridden (= ). Resources and modules may be imported at the same time by globbing with the Globbed Imports and Globbed Reads features. Pkl’s glob patterns mostly follow the rules described by glob(7), with the following differences: * includes names that start with a dot (.). ** behaves like *, except it also matches directory boundary characters (/). Named character classes are not supported. Collating symbols are not supported. Equivalence class expressions are not supported. Support for sub-patterns (patterns within { and }) are added. Here is a full specification of how globs work: The following tokens denote wildcards: Wildcard Meaning * Match zero or more characters, until a directory boundary (/) is reached. ** Match zero or more characters, crossing directory boundaries. ? Match a single character. […​] Match a single character represented by this character class. Unlike globs within shells, the * wildcard includes names that start with a dot (.). Character classes are sequences delimited by the [ and ] characters, and represent a single character as described by the sequence within the enclosed brackets. For example, the pattern [abc] means \"a single character that is a, b, or c\". Character classes may be negated using !. For example, the pattern [!abc] means \"a single character that is not a, b, nor c\". Character classes may use the - character to denote a range. The pattern [a-f] is equivalent to [abcdef]. If the - character exists at the beginning or the end of a character class, it does not carry any special meaning. Within a character class, the characters {, }, \\, *, and ? do not have any special meaning. A character class is not allowed to be empty. Thus, if the first character within the character class is ], it is treated literally and not as the closing delimiter of the character class. For example, the glob pattern []abc] matches a single character that is either ], a, b, or c. Sub-patterns are glob patterns delimited by the { and } characters, and separated by the , character. For example, the pattern {pigeon,parrot} will match either pigeon or parrot. Sub-patterns cannot be nested. The pattern {foo,{bar,baz}} is not a valid glob pattern, and an error will be thrown during evaluation. The escape character (\\) can be used to remove the special meaning of a character. The following escapes are valid: \\[ \\* \\? \\\\ \\{ All other escapes are considered a syntax error and an error is thrown. If incorporating escape characters into a glob pattern, use custom string delimiters to express the glob pattern. For example, import*(#\"\\{foo.pkl\"#). This way, the backslash is interpreted as a backslash and not a string escape. Pattern Description *.pc[lf] Anything suffixed by .pkl, or .pcf. **.y{a,}ml Anything suffixed by either yml or yaml, crossing directory boundaries. birds/{*.yml,*.json} Anything within the birds subdirectory that ends in .yml or .json. This pattern is equivalent to birds/*.{yml,json}. a?*.txt Anything starting with a and at least one more letter, and suffixed with .txt. modulepath:/**.pkl All Pkl files in the module path. An identifier is the name part of an entity in Pkl. Entities that are named by identifiers include classes, properties, typealiases, and modules. For example, class Bird has the identifier Bird. Normally, an identifier must conform to Unicode’s UAX31-R1-1 syntax, with the additions of _ and $ permitted as identifier start characters. Additionally, an identifier cannot clash with a keyword. To define an identifier that is otherwise illegal, enclose them in backticks. This is called a quoted identifier. `A Bird's First Flight Time` = 5.s Backticks are not part of a quoted identifier’s name, and surrounding an already legal identifier with backticks is redundant. `number` = 42 (1) res1 = `number` (2) res2 = number (3) 1 Equivalent to number = 42 2 References property `number` 3 Also references property `number` Doc comments are the user-facing documentation of a module and its members. They consist of one or more lines starting with a triple slash (///). Here is a doc comment for a module: /// An aviated animal going by the name of [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird). /// /// These animals live on the planet Earth. module com.animals.Birds Doc comments are written in Markdown. The following Markdown features are supported: all CommonMark features GitHub flavored Markdown tables Plaintext URLs are only rendered as links when enclosed in angle brackets: /// A link is *not* generated for https://example.com. /// A link *is* generated for . Doc comments are consumed by humans reading source code, the Pkldoc documentation generator, code generators, and editor/IDE plugins. They are programmatically accessible via the pkl.reflect Pkl API and ModuleSchema Java API. Doc Comment Style Guidelines Use proper spelling and grammar. Start each sentence on a new line and capitalize the first letter. End each sentence with a punctuation mark. The first paragraph of a doc comment is its summary. Keep the summary short (a single sentence is common) and insert an empty line (///) before the next paragraph. Doc comments can be attached to module, class, type alias, property, and method declarations. Here is a comprehensive example: Birds.pkl /// An aviated animal going by the name of [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird). /// /// These animals live on the planet Earth. module com.animals.Birds /// A bird living on Earth. /// /// Has [name] and [lifespan] properties and an [isOlderThan()] method. class Bird { /// The name of this bird. name: String /// The lifespan of this bird. lifespan: UInt8 /// Tells if this bird is older than [bird]. function isOlderThan(bird: Bird): Boolean = lifespan > bird.lifespan } /// An adult [Bird]. typealias Adult = Bird(lifespan >= 2) /// A common [Bird] found in large cities. pigeon: Bird = new { name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 } /// Creates a [Bird] with the given [_name] and lifespan `0`. function Infant(_name: String): Bird = new { name = _name; lifespan = 0 } To link to a member declaration, write the member’s name enclosed in square brackets ([]): /// A common [Bird] found in large cities. To customize the link text, insert the desired text, enclosed in square brackets, before the member name: /// A [common Bird][Bird] found in large cities. Custom link text can use markup: /// A [*common* Bird][Bird] found in large cities. The short link [Bird] is equivalent to [`Bird`][Bird]. Member links are resolved according to Pkl’s normal name resolution rules. The syntax for linking to the members of Birds.pkl (see above) is as follows: Module [module] (from same module) [Birds] (from a module that contains import \"Birds.pkl\") Class [Bird] (from same module) [Birds.Bird] (from a module that contains import \"Birds.pkl\") Type Alias [Adult] (from same module) [Birds.Adult] (from a module that contains import \"Birds.pkl\") Class Property [name] (from same class) [Bird.name] (from same module) [Birds.Bird.name] (from a module that contains import \"Birds.pkl\") Class Method [greet()] (from same class) [Bird.greet()] (from same module) [Birds.Bird.greet()] (from a module that contains import \"Birds.pkl\") Class Method Parameter [bird] (from same method) Module Property [pigeon] (from same module) [Birds.pigeon] (from a module that contains import \"Birds.pkl\") Module Method [isPigeon()] (from same module) [Birds.isPigeon()] (from a module that contains import \"Birds.pkl\") Module Method Parameter [bird] (from same method) Members of pkl.base can be linked to by their simple name: /// Returns a [String]. Module-level members can be prefixed with module. to resolve name conflicts: /// See [module.pigeon]. To exclude a member from documentation and code completion, annotate it with @Unlisted: @Unlisted pigeon: Bird The following member links are marked up as code but not rendered as links:[9] [null], [true], [false], [this], [unknown], [nothing] self-links subsequent links to the same member from the same doc comment links to a method’s own parameters Nevertheless, it is a good practice to use member links in the above cases. Consider this snippet of code buried deep inside a config file: a = x + 1 The call site’s \"variable\" syntax reveals that x refers to a LAMP (let binding, anonymous function parameter, method parameter, or property) definition. But which one? To answer this question, Pkl follows these steps: Search the lexically enclosing scopes of x, starting with the scope in which x occurs and continuing outwards up to and including the enclosing module’s top-level scope, for a LAMP definition named x. If a match is found, this is the answer. Search the pkl.base module for a top-level definition of property x. If a match is found, this is the answer. Search the prototype chain of this, from bottom to top, for a definition of property x. If a match is found, this is the answer. Throw a \"name x not found\" error. Pkl’s LAMP name resolution is inspired by Newspeak. The goal is for name resolution to be stable with regard to changes in external modules. This is why lexically enclosing scopes are searched before the prototype chain of this, and why the prototype chains of lexically enclosing scopes are not searched, which sometimes requires the use of outer. or module.. For name resolution to fully stabilize, the list of top-level properties defined in pkl.base needs to be freezed. This is tentatively planned for Pkl 1.0. Consider this snippet of code buried deep inside a config file: a = x(\"foo\") + 1 The call site’s method call syntax reveals that x refers to a method definition. But which one? To answer this question, Pkl follows these steps: Search the call sites' lexically enclosing scopes, starting with the scope in which the call site occurs and continuing outwards up to and including the enclosing module’s top-level scope, for a definition of method x. If a match is found, this is the answer. Search the pkl.base module for a top-level definition of method x. If a match is found, this is the answer. Search the class inheritance chain of this, starting with the class of this and continuing upwards until and including class Any, for a method named x. If a match is found, this is the answer. Throw a \"method x not found\" error. Pkl does not support arity or type-based method overloading. Hence, the argument list of a method call is irrelevant for method resolution. Pkl’s object model is based on prototypical inheritance. The prototype chain of object[10] x contains, from bottom to top: The chain of objects amended to create x, ending in x itself, in reverse order.[11] The prototype of the class of the top object in (1). If no amending took place, this is the class of x. The prototypes of the superclasses of (2). The prototype of class X is an instance of X that defines the defaults for properties defined in X. Its direct ancestor in the prototype chain is the prototype of the superclass of X. The prototype of class Any sits at the top of every prototype chain. To reduce the chance of naming collisions, Any does not define any property names.[12] Consider the following code: one = new Dynamic { name = \"Pigeon\" } two = (one) { lifespan = 8 } The prototype chain of object two contains, now listed from top to bottom: The prototype of class Any. The prototype of class Dynamic. one two Consider the following code: abstract class Named { name: String } class Bird extends Named { lifespan: Int = 42 } one = new Bird { name = \"Pigeon\" } two = (one) { lifespan = 8 } The prototype chain of object two contains, listed from top to bottom: The prototype of class Any. The prototype of class Typed. The prototype of class Named. The prototype of class Bird. one two The prototype chain of non-object value x contains, from bottom to top: The prototype of the class of x. The prototypes of the superclasses of (1). For example, the prototype chain of value 42 contains, now listed from top to bottom: The prototype of class Any. The prototype of class Number. The prototype of class Int. A prototype chain never contains a non-object value, such as 42. Pkl’s ANTLR 4 grammar is defined in PklLexer.g4 and PklParser.g4. The following keywords are reserved in the language. They cannot be used as a regular identifier, and currently do not have any meaning. protected override record delete case switch vararg To use these names in an identifier, surround them with backticks. Blank identifiers can be used in many places to ignore parameters and variables. _ is not a valid identifier. To use it as a parameter or variable name, it needs to be enclosed in backticks: `_`. birds = List(\"Robin\", \"Swallow\", \"Eagle\", \"Falcon\") indexes = birds.mapIndexed((i, _) -> i) function constantly(_, second) = second birdColors = Map(\"Robin\", \"blue\", \"Eagle\", \"white\", \"Falcon\", \"red\") birds = new Listing { for (name, _ in birdColors) { name } } name = let (_ = trace(\"defining name\")) \"Eagle\" birds = new Dynamic { default { _ -> species = \"Bird\" } [\"Falcon\"] {} [\"Eagle\"] {} } A project is a directory of Pkl modules and other resources. It is defined by the presence of a PklProject file that amends the standard library module pkl:Project. Defining a project serves the following purposes: It allows defining common evaluator settings for Pkl modules within a logical project. It helps with managing package dependencies for Pkl modules within a logical project. It enables packaging and sharing the contents of the project as a package. It allows importing packages via dependency notation. A project is useful for managing package dependencies. Within a PklProject file, dependencies can be defined: PklProject amends \"pkl:Project\" dependencies { [\"birds\"] { (1) uri = \"package://example.com/birds@1.0.0\" } } 1 Declare dependency on package://example.com/birds@1.0.0 with simple name \"birds\". These dependencies can then be imported by their simple name. This syntax is called dependency notation. Example: import \"@birds/Bird.pkl\" (1) pigeon: Bird = new { name = \"Pigeon\" } 1 Dependency notation; imports path /Bird.pkl within dependency package://example.com/birds@1.0.0 Internally, Pkl assigns URI scheme projectpackage to project dependencies imported using dependency notation. When the project gets published as a package, these names and URIs are preserved as the package’s dependencies. Dependencies that are declared in a PklProject file must be resolved via CLI command pkl project resolve. This builds a single dependency list, resolving all transitive dependencies, and determines the appropriate version for each package. It creates or updates a file called PklProject.deps.json in the project’s root directory with the list of resolved dependencies. When resolving version conflicts, the CLI will pick the latest semver minor version of each package. For example, if the project declares a dependency on package A at 1.2.0, and a package transitively declares a dependency on package A at 1.3.0, version 1.3.0 is selected. In short, the algorithm has the following steps: Gather a list of all dependencies, either directly declared or transitive. For each dependency, keep only the newest minor version. The resolve command is idempotent; given a PklProject file, it always produces the same set of resolved dependencies. This algorithm is adapted from Go’s minimum version selection. Projects enable the creation of a package. To create a package, the package section of a PklProject module must be defined. PklProject amends \"pkl:Project\" package { name = \"mypackage\" (1) baseUri = \"package://example.com/\\(name)\" (2) version = \"1.0.0\" (3) packageZipUrl = \"https://example.com/\\(name)/\\(name)@\\(version).zip\" (4) } 1 The display name of the package.For display purposes only. 2 The package URI, without the version part. 3 The version of the package. 4 The URL to download the package’s ZIP file. The package itself is created by the command pkl project package. This command only prepares artifacts to be published. Once the artifacts are prepared, they are expected to be uploaded to an HTTPS server such that the ZIP asset can be downloaded at path packageZipUrl, and the metadata can be downloaded at https://. A project can depend on a local project as a dependency. This can be useful for: Structuring a monorepo that publishes multiple packages. Temporarily testing out library changes when used within another project. To specify a local dependency, import its PklProject file. The imported PklProject must have a package section defined. birds/PklProject amends \"pkl:Project\" dependencies { [\"fruit\"] = import(\"../fruit/PklProject\") (1) } package { name = \"birds\" baseUri = \"package://example.com/birds\" version = \"1.8.3\" packageZipUrl = \"https://example.com/birds@\\(version).zip\" } 1 Specify relative project ../fruit as a dependency. fruit/PklProject amends \"pkl:Project\" package { name = \"fruit\" baseUri = \"package://example.com/fruit\" version = \"1.5.0\" packageZipUrl = \"https://example.com/fruit@\\(version).zip\" } From the perspective of project birds, fruit is just another package. It can be imported using dependency notation, i.e. import \"@fruit/Pear.pkl\". At runtime, it will resolve to relative path ../fruit/Pear.pkl. When packaging projects with local dependencies, both the project and its dependent project must be passed to the pkl project package command. External readers are a mechanism to extend the module and resource URI schemes that Pkl supports. Readers are implemented as ordinary executables and use Pkl’s message passing API to communicate with the hosting Pkl evaluator. The Swift and Go language binding libraries provide an ExternalReaderRuntime type to facilitate implementing external readers. External readers are configured separately for modules and resources. They are registered by mapping their URI scheme to the executable to run and additonal arguments to pass. This is done on the command line by passing --external-resource-reader and --external-module-reader flags, which may both be passed multiple times. $ pkl eval --external-resource-reader = --external-module-reader =' ' External readers may also be configured in a Project’s PklProject file. evaluatorSettings { externalResourceReaders { [\"\"] { executable = \"\" } } externalModuleReaders { [\"\"] { executable = \"\" arguments { \"\"; \"\" } } } } Registering an external reader for a scheme automatically adds that scheme to the default allowed modules/resources. As with Pkl’s built-in module and resource schemes, setting explicit allowed modules or resources overrides this behavior and appropriate patterns must be specified to allow use of external readers. Consider this module: username = \"pigeon\" email = read(\"ldap://ds.example.com:389/dc=example,dc=com?mail?sub?(uid=\\(username))\").text Pkl doesn’t implement the ldap: resource URI scheme natively, but an external reader can provide it. Assuming a hypothetical pkl-ldap executable implementing the external reader protocol and the ldap: scheme is in the $PATH, this module can be evaluated as: $ pkl eval --external-resource-reader ldap=pkl-ldap username = \"pigeon\" email = \"pigeon@example.com\" In this example, the external reader may provide both ldap: and ldaps: schemes. To support both schemes during evaluation, both would need to be registered explicitly: $ pkl eval --external-resource-reader ldap=pkl-ldap --external-resource-reader ldaps=pkl-ldap 1. Pkl’s string literals have fewer character escape sequences, have stricter rules for line indentation in multiline strings, and do not have a line continuation character. 2. By \"structure\" we mean a list of property names and (optionally) property types. 3. By \"Use typed objects\" we mean to define classes and build data models out of instances of these classes. 4. Not counting that every module is a typed object. 5. Strictly speaking, List, Set, and Map are currently soft keywords. The goal is to eventually turn them into regular standard library methods. 6. Also known as dynamic type. We do not use that term to avoid confusion with Dynamic, Pkl’s dynamic object type. 7. More precisely, they cannot generate properties with a non-constant name. 8. Values that are Typed are not iterable. 9. Only applies to links without custom link text. 10. An instance of Listing, Mapping, Dynamic, or (a subclass of) Typed. 11. All objects in this chain are instances of the same class, except when a direct conversion between listing, mapping, dynamic, and typed object has occurred. For example, Typed.toDynamic() returns a dynamic object that amends a typed object. 12. Method resolution searches the class inheritance rather than prototype chain.","title":"Language

part of the Pkl tutorial, you build familiarity with Pkl syntax and basic structure. You also learn different ways to invoke Pkl to produce different formats. Consider the following example Pkl file. intro.pkl name = \"Pkl: Configure your Systems in New Ways\" attendants = 100 isInteractive = true amountLearned = 13.37 Running Pkl on this file gives $ pkl eval /Users/me/tutorial/intro.pkl name = \"Pkl: Configure your Systems in New Ways\" attendants = 100 isInteractive = true amountLearned = 13.37 It may seem nothing happened. However, Pkl tells you that it accepts the input. In other words, you now know that intro.pkl does not contain any errors. You can ask Pkl to print this configuration in a different format, using the -f option. For example, JSON: $ pkl eval -f json /Users/me/tutorial/intro.pkl { \"name\": \"Pkl: Configure your Systems in New Ways\", \"attendants\": 100, \"isInteractive\": true, \"amountLearned\": 13.37 } Or PropertyList format: $ pkl eval -f plist /Users/me/tutorial/intro.pkl name Pkl: Configure your Systems in New Ways attendants 100 isInteractive amountLearned 13.37 Notice that Pkl generated , , and for the values in your configuration. This means it has both correctly derived the types of the literal values and translated those types to the corresponding elements in the PropertyList. Part III goes into types in more detail. A configuration often requires more than just basic values. Typically, you need some kind of (hierarchical) structure. Pkl provides immutable objects for this. Objects have three kinds of members: properties, elements and entries. First, look at the syntax for objects and their members. simpleObjectWithProperties.pkl bird { (1) name = \"Common wood pigeon\" (2) diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { (3) species = \"Columba palumbus\" } } 1 This defines bird to be an object 2 For primitive values, Pkl has the = syntax (more on this later). 3 Just like bird {, but to show that objects can be nested. This defines an object called bird with three named properties: name, diet, and taxonomy. The first two of these are strings, but taxonomy is another object. This means properties in an object can have different types and objects can be nested. Of course, you don’t always have names for every individual structure in your configuration. What if you want \"just a bunch of things\" without knowing how many? Pkl offers elements for this purpose. Elements are object members, just like properties. Where you index properties by their name, you index elements by an integer. You can think of an object that only contains elements as array. Much like arrays in many languages, you can use square brackets to access an element, for example, myObject[42]. You write an element, by writing only an expression. Pkl derives the index from the number of elements already in the object. For example: simpleObjectsWithElements.pkl exampleObjectWithJustIntElements { 100 (1) 42 } exampleObjectWithMixedElements { \"Bird Breeder Conference\" (2000 + 23) (2) exampleObjectWithJustIntElements (3) } 1 When you write only the value (without a name), you describe an element. 2 Elements don’t have to be literal values; they can be arbitrary expressions. 3 Elements can really be any value, not just primitive values. Objects can have one more kind of member; entries. Like a property, an entry is \"named\" (technically keyed). Unlike a property, the name does not need to be known at declaration time. Of course, we need a syntax to tell entries apart from properties. You write entry \"names\" by enclosing them in square brackets (\"names\" is quoted, because the names do not need to be strings; any value can index entries). simpleObjectsWithEntries.pkl pigeonShelter { [\"bird\"] { (1) name = \"Common wood pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { species = \"Columba palumbus\" } } [\"address\"] = \"355 Bird St.\" (2) } birdCount { [pigeonShelter] = 42 (3) } 1 The difference with properties is the notation of the key: []. 2 As with properties, entries can be primitive values or objects. 3 Any object can be used as a key for an entry. In the examples so far, you have seen objects with properties, object with elements and object with entries. These object members can be freely mixed. mixedObject.pkl mixedObject { name = \"Pigeon\" lifespan = 8 \"wing\" \"claw\" [\"wing\"] = \"Not related to the _element_ \\\"wing\\\"\" 42 extinct = false [false] { description = \"Construed object example\" } } Notice, how properties (name, lifespan and extinct), elements (\"wing\", \"claw\", 42) and entries (\"wing\", false) are mixed together in this one object. You don’t have to order them by kind, and you don’t require (other) special syntax. This free-for-all mixing of object members can become confusing. Also, target formats are often considerably more restrictive. In the following example, you see what happens when you try to produce JSON from mixedObject: $ pkl eval -f json /Users/me/tutorial/mixedObject.pkl –– Pkl Error –– Cannot render object with both properties/entries and elements as JSON. Object: \"Pigeon\" 89 | text = renderer.renderDocument(value) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ at pkl.base#Module.output.text (https://github.com/apple/pkl/blob/0.24.0/stdlib/base.pkl#L90) This is why Pkl has two special types of object, namely listings, which contain exclusively elements, and mappings, which contain exclusively entries. Both listings and mappings are \"just objects,\" so, they don’t require syntax besides that of objects: collections.pkl birds { (1) \"Pigeon\" \"Parrot\" \"Barn owl\" \"Falcon\" } habitats { (2) [\"Pigeon\"] = \"Streets\" [\"Parrot\"] = \"Parks\" [\"Barn owl\"] = \"Forests\" [\"Falcon\"] = \"Mountains\" } 1 A listing containing four elements. 2 A mapping containing four entries. Technically, the correct way to define birds and habitats is by using new Listing {…​} and new Mapping {…​} explicitly. You will see what these mean in part three of this tutorial. When you render this configuration as JSON, everything works: { \"birds\": [ \"Pigeon\", \"Parrot\", \"Barn owl\", \"Falcon\" ], \"habitats\": { \"Pigeon\": \"Streets\", \"Parrot\": \"Parks\", \"Barn owl\": \"Forests\", \"Falcon\": \"Mountains\" } } Notice particularly, that you rendered the listing as a JSON array. When you index the listing with an integer, you’re referring to the element inside the listing at the corresponding position (starting from 0). For example: indexedListing.pkl birds { \"Pigeon\" \"Parrot\" \"Barn owl\" \"Falcon\" } relatedToSnowOwl = birds[2] results in birds { \"Pigeon\" \"Parrot\" \"Barn owl\" \"Falcon\" } relatedToSnowOwl = \"Barn owl\" Given the following JSON snippet (taken from W3C examples), write the .pkl file that produces this JSON: { \"name\": \"Common wood pigeon\", \"lifespan\": 8, \"friends\": { \"bird1\": \"Parrot\", \"bird2\": \"Albatross\", \"bird3\": \"Falcon\" } } For some reason, we decide we no longer need the birdX names of the different birds; we just need them as an array. Change your solution to the previous question to produce the following JSON result: { \"name\": \"Common wood pigeon\", \"lifespan\": 8, \"birds\": [\"Parrot\", \"Barn owl\", \"Falcon\"] }","title":"Basic Configuration","component":"main","version":"0.27.1","name":"01_basic_config","url":"/main/current/language-tutorial/01_basic_config.html","titles":[{"text":"Basic values","hash":"basic-values","id":1},{"text":"Structure: Classes, objects, modules","hash":"structure-classes-objects-modules","id":2},{"text":"Properties","hash":"properties","id":3},{"text":"Elements","hash":"elements","id":4},{"text":"Entries","hash":"entries","id":5},{"text":"Mixed members","hash":"mixed-members","id":6},{"text":"Collections","hash":"collections","id":7},{"text":"Exercises","hash":"exercises","id":8}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"In this second part of the Pkl tutorial, you will learn how to write one (part of a) configuration in terms of another. You will also find and fill out an existing template. The central mechanism in Pkl for expressing one (part of a) configuration in terms of another is amending. Consider the following example. amendingObjects.pkl bird { name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Dinosauria\" order = \"Columbiformes\" } } parrot = (bird) { name = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Berries\" taxonomy { order = \"Psittaciformes\" } } Parrot and Pigeon have nearly identical properties. They only differ in their name and taxonomy, so if you have already written out bird, you can say that parrot is just like bird except name is \"Parrot\", diet is \"Berries\" the taxonomy.order is \"Psittaciformes\". When you run this, Pkl expands everything fully. bird { name = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Dinosauria\" order = \"Columbiformes\" } } parrot { name = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Berries\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Dinosauria\" order = \"Psittaciformes\" } } So far, you have only worked with Dynamic objects. Pkl also offers Typed objects. Amending allows you to override, amend, and add new properties to a dynamic object. Typed objects will only let you amend or override existing properties, not add entirely new ones. The next part of the tutorial discusses types in more detail. There, you see that amending never changes the type of the object. You can also amend nested objects. This allows you to only describe the difference with the outermost object for arbitrarily deeply nested structures. Consider the following example. nestedAmends.pkl stockPigeon { name = \"Stock pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Columbimorphae\" order = \"Columbiformes\" species = \"Columba oenas\" } } woodPigeon = (stockPigeon) { name = \"Common wood pigeon\" taxonomy { (1) species = \"Columba palumbus\" } } dodo = (woodPigeon) { (2) name = \"Dodo\" extinct = true (3) taxonomy { species = \"Raphus cucullatus\" } } 1 This amends species, as it occurs in stockPigeon. 2 Amended objects can, themselves, be amended. 3 New fields can be added to objects when amending. Notice how you only have to change taxonomy.species. In this example, stockPigeon.taxonomy has kingdom, clade, order and species. You are amending stockPigeon, to define woodPigeon. They have the same taxonomy, except for species. This notation says that everything in taxonomy should be what it is in the object you are amending (stockPigeon), except for species, which should be \"Columba palumbus\" . For the input above, Pkl produces the following output. stockPigeon { name = \"Stock pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Columbimorphae\" order = \"Columbiformes\" species = \"Columba oenas\" } } woodPigeon { name = \"Common wood pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Columbimorphae\" order = \"Columbiformes\" species = \"Columba palumbus\" } } dodo { name = \"Dodo\" diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Columbimorphae\" order = \"Columbiformes\" species = \"Raphus cucullatus\" } extinct = true } So far, you have only amended properties. Since you refer to them by name, it makes sense that you \"overwrite\" the value from the object you’re amending. What if you include elements or entries in an amends expression? amendElementsAndEntries.pkl favoriteFoods { \"red berries\" \"blue berries\" [\"Barn owl\"] { \"mice\" } } adultBirdFoods = (favoriteFoods) { [1] = \"pebbles\" (1) \"worms\" (2) [\"Falcon\"] { (3) \"insects\" \"amphibians\" } [\"Barn owl\"] { (4) \"fish\" } } 1 Explicitly amending by index replaces the element at that index. 2 Without explicit indices, Pkl can’t know which element to overwrite, so, instead, it adds an element to the object you’re amending. 3 When you write \"new\" entries (using a key that does not occur in the object you’re amending), Pkl also adds them. 4 When you write an entry using a key that exists, this notation amends its value. Pkl can’t know which of the favoriteFoods to overwrite only by their value. When you want to replace an element, you have to explicitly amend the element at a specific index. This is why a \"plain\" element in an amends expression is added to the object being amended. Result: favoriteFoods { [\"Barn owl\"] { \"mice\" } \"red berries\" \"blue berries\" } adultBirdFoods { [\"Barn owl\"] { \"mice\" \"fish\" } \"red berries\" \"pebbles\" [\"Falcon\"] { \"insects\" \"amphibians\" } \"worms\" } A .pkl file describes a module. Modules are objects that can be referred to from other modules. Going back to the example above, you can write parrot as a separate module. pigeon.pkl name = \"Common wood pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Dinosauria\" species = \"Columba palumbus\" } You can import this module and express parrot like you did before. parrot.pkl import \"pigeon.pkl\" (1) parrot = (pigeon) { name = \"Great green macaw\" diet = \"Berries\" taxonomy { species = \"Ara ambiguus\" } } 1 Importing pigeon.pkl creates the object pigeon, so you can refer to pigeon in this code, like you did before. If you run Pkl on both, you will see that it works. Looking at the result, however, you see a (possibly) unexpected difference. $ pkl eval /Users/me/tutorial/pigeon.pkl name = \"Common wood pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Dinosauria\" species = \"Columba palumbus\" } $ pkl eval /Users/me/tutorial/parrot.pkl parrot { name = \"Great green macaw\" diet = \"Berries\" taxonomy { kingdom = \"Animalia\" clade = \"Dinosauria\" species = \"Ara ambiguus\" } } The object pigeon is \"spread\" in the top-level, while parrot is a nested and named object. This is because writing parrot {…​} defines an object property in the \"current\" module. In order to say that \"this module is an object, amended from the pigeon module,\" you use an amends clause. parrot.pkl amends \"pigeon.pkl\" (1) name = \"Great green macaw\" 1 \"This\" module is the same as \"pigeon.pkl\", except for what is in the remainder of the file. As a first intuition, think of \"amending a module\" as \"filling out a form.\" A Pkl file can be either a template or a \"normal\" module. This terminology describes the intended use of the module and doesn’t imply anything about its structure. In other words: just by looking at Pkl code, you can’t tell whether it is a template or a \"normal\" module. AcmeCICD.pkl module AcmeCICD class Pipeline { name: String(nameRequiresBranchName)? hidden nameRequiresBranchName = (_) -> if (branchName == null) throw(\"Pipelines that set a 'name' must also set a 'branchName'.\") else true branchName: String? } timeout: Int(this >= 3) pipelines: Listing output { renderer = new YamlRenderer {} } Remember that amending is like filling out a form. That’s exactly what you’re doing here; you’re filling out \"work order forms\". Next, add a time-out of one minute for your job. cicd.pkl amends \"AcmeCICD.pkl\" timeout = 1 Unfortunately, Pkl does not accept this configuration and provides a rather elaborate error message: –– Pkl Error –– (1) Type constraint `this >= 3` violated. (2) Value: 1 (3) 225 | timeout: Int(this >= 3)? (4) ^^^^^^^^^ at AcmeCICD#timeout (file:///Users/me/tutorial/AcmeCICD.pkl, line 8) 3 | timeout = 1 (5) ^ at cicd#timeout (file:///Users/me/tutorial/cicd.pkl, line 3) 90 | text = renderer.renderDocument(value) (6) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ at pkl.base#Module.output.text (https://github.com/apple/pkl/blob/e4d8c882d/stdlib/base.pkl#L90) 1 Pkl found an error. 2 Which error Pkl found. 3 What the offending value is. 4 Where Pkl found its expectation (line 8 of the amended module). 5 Where Pkl found the offending value (line 3 of the input module). 6 What Pkl evaluated to discover the error. When Pkl prints source locations, it also prints clickable links for easy access. For local files, it generates a link for your development environment (configurable in ~/.pkl/settings.pkl). For packages imported from elsewhere, if available, Pkl produces https:// links to their repository. Pkl complains about a type constraint. Pkl’s type system doesn’t just protect you from providing a String where you expected an Int, it even checks which values are allowed. In this case, the minimum time-out is three minutes. If you change the value to 3, Pkl accepts your configuration. $ pkl eval cicd.pkl timeout: 3 pipelines: [] You can now define a pipeline. Start off by specifying the name of the pipeline and nothing else. cicd.pkl amends \"AcmeCICD.pkl\" timeout = 3 pipelines { new { (1) name = \"prb\" } } 1 There is no pipeline object to amend. The new keyword gives you an object to amend. So far, you’ve defined objects the same way you amended them. If the name foo didn’t occur before, foo { …​ } creates a property called foo and assigns to it the contents in place of the …​ (given that …​ is not valid Pkl, but an abbreviation for illustration purposes). If foo is an existing object, this notation is an amend expression; resulting in a new object (value), but not a new (named) property. Since pipelines is a listing, you can add elements by writing expressions in an amend expression. In this case, though, there is no object to amend. Writing myNewPipeline { …​ } defines a property, but listings may only include elements. This is where you can use the keyword new. new gives you an object to amend. Pkl derives from the context in which new is used and what the object to amend should look like. This is called the default value for the context. The next part goes into detail about how Pkl does this. Running Pkl on your new configuration produces a verbose error. cicd.pkl –– Pkl Error –– Pipelines that set a 'name' must also set a 'branchName'. 8 | throw(\"Pipelines that set a 'name' must also set a 'branchName'.\") ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ at AcmeCICD#Pipeline.nameRequiresBranchName.

In this case, the error message consists of an English language sentence, instead of Pkl code. When constraints are complicated or very application specific, template authors can throw a more descriptive error message like this. The message is quite instructive, so you can fix the error by adding a branchName. cicd.pkl amends \"AcmeCICD.pkl\" timeout = 3 pipelines { new { name = \"prb\" branchName = \"main\" } } and indeed $ pkl eval -f yml /Users/me/tutorial/cicd.pkl timeout: 3 pipelines: - name: prb branchName: main","title":"Filling out a Template","component":"main","version":"0.27.1","name":"02_filling_out_a_template","url":"/main/current/language-tutorial/02_filling_out_a_template.html","titles":[{"text":"Composing configurations","hash":"composing-configurations","id":1},{"text":"Amending","hash":"amending","id":2},{"text":"Modules","hash":"modules","id":3},{"text":"Amending templates","hash":"amending-templates","id":4}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"In parts one and two, you saw that Pkl provides validation of our configurations. It checks syntax, types and constraints. As you saw in the AcmeCICD example here, the template can provide informative error messages when an amending module violates a type constraint. In this final part, you will see some of Pkl’s techniques that are particularly relevant for writing a template. Pkl always checks the syntax of its input. As it evaluates your configuration, it also checks types. You’ve seen objects, listings, and mappings already. These provide ways to write structured configuration. Before you can write types for them, you need to know how to write the types for the simplest (unstructured) values. These are all Pkl’s basic types: pklTutorialPart3.pkl name: String = \"Writing a Template\" part: Int = 3 hasExercises: Boolean = true amountLearned: Float = 13.37 duration: Duration = 30.min bandwidthRequirementPerSecond: DataSize = 52.4288.mb In the above, you’ve explicitly annotated the code with type signatures. The default output of Pkl is actually pcf, which is a subset of Pkl. Since pcf does not have type signatures, running Pkl on this example removes them. $ pkl eval pklTutorialPart3.pkl name = \"Writing a Template\" part = 3 hasExercises = true amountLearned = 13.37 duration = 30.min bandwidthRequirementPerSecond = 52.4288.mb Note how Duration and DataSize help you prevent unit errors in these common (for configuration) domains. Having a notation for basic types, you can now write typed objects. simpleClass.pkl class Language { (1) name: String } bestForConfig: Language = new { (2) name = \"Pkl\" } 1 A class definition. 2 A property definition, using the Language class. Although not required (or enforced), it’s customary to name properties starting with a lower-case letter. Class names, by that same convention, start with an upper-case letter. You can type objects with classes. In this example, you define a class called Language. You can now be certain that every instance of Language has a property name with type String. Types and values are different things in Pkl. Pkl does not render types in its output,[1] so when you run Pkl on this, you don’t see the class definition at all. $ pkl eval simpleClass.pkl bestForConfig { name = \"Pkl\" } Did you notice that the output doesn’t just omit the type signature, but also the = new? We will discuss this further in the next section. When your configuration describes a few different parts like this, you can define one instance and amend it for every other instance. For example: pklTutorialParts.pkl class TutorialPart { name: String part: Int hasExercises: Boolean amountLearned: Float duration: Duration bandwidthRequirementPerSecond: DataSize } pklTutorialPart1: TutorialPart = new { name = \"Basic Configuration\" part = 1 hasExercises = true amountLearned = 13.37 duration = 30.min bandwidthRequirementPerSecond = 50.mib.toUnit(\"mb\") } pklTutorialPart2: TutorialPart = (pklTutorialPart1) { name = \"Filling out a Template\" part = 2 } pklTutorialPart3: TutorialPart = (pklTutorialPart1) { name = \"Writing a Template\" part = 3 } You can read this as saying \"pklTutorialPart2 & pklTutorialPart3 are exactly like pklTutorialPart1, except for their name and part.\" Running Pkl confirms this: $ pkl eval pklTutorialParts.pkl pklTutorialPart1 { name = \"Basic Configuration\" part = 1 hasExercises = true amountLearned = 13.37 duration = 30.min bandwidthRequirementPerSecond = 52.4288.mb } pklTutorialPart2 { name = \"Filling out a Template\" part = 2 hasExercises = true amountLearned = 13.37 duration = 30.min bandwidthRequirementPerSecond = 52.4288.mb } pklTutorialPart3 { name = \"Writing a Template\" part = 3 hasExercises = true amountLearned = 13.37 duration = 30.min bandwidthRequirementPerSecond = 52.4288.mb } Sadly, pklTutorialParts.pkl is a rewrite of pklTutorialPart3.pkl. It creates a separate class TutorialPart and instantiates three properties with it (pklTutorialPart1, pklTutorialPart2 and pklTutorialPart3). In doing so, it implicitly moves everything \"down\" one level (pklTutorialPart3 is now a property in the module pklTutorialParts, whereas above, in pklTutorialPart3.pkl it was its own module). This is not very DRY. As a matter of fact, you don’t need this rewrite. Any .pkl file defines a module in Pkl. Any module is represented by a module class, which is an actual Pkl class. A module is not quite the same as any other class, because Pkl never renders class definitions on the output. However, when you ran Pkl on pklTutorialPart3.pkl, it did produce an output. This is because a module also defines an instance of the module class. The values given to properties in a module (or in any \"normal\" class) are called default values. When you instantiate a class, all the properties for which you don’t provide a value are populated from the class' default values. In our examples of tutorial parts, only the name and part varied across instances. You can express this by adding default values to the (module) class definition. Instead of starting from a particular tutorial part, you can define the module tutorialPart as follows: TutorialPart.pkl name: String (1) part: Int (1) hasExercises: Boolean = true (2) amountLearned: Float = 13.37 (2) duration: Duration = 30.min (2) bandwidthRequirementPerSecond: DataSize = 52.4288.mb (2) 1 No default value given. 2 Default value given. Running this through Pkl gives an error, or course, because of the missing values: $ pkl eval TutorialPart.pkl –– Pkl Error –– Tried to read property `name` but its value is undefined. 1 | name: String ^^^^ ... An individual part now only has to fill in the missing fields, so you can change pklTutorialPart3.pkl to amend this: pklTutorialPart3.pkl amends \"TutorialPart.pkl\" name = \"Writing a Template\" part = 3 This results in $ pkl eval pklTutorialPart3.pkl name = \"Writing a Template\" part = 3 hasExercises = true amountLearned = 13.37 duration = 30.min bandwidthRequirementPerSecond = 52.4288.mb This now behaves exactly like our pklTutorialPart3: TutorialPart = (pklTutorialPart1) {…​ before. pklTutorialPart3 is now defined as the value we get by amending tutorialPart and giving it a name and a part. Amending anything never changes its type. When we amend an object of type Foo, the result will always be precisely of type Foo. By \"precisely\" we mean, that amending an object also can’t \"turn it into\" an instance of a sub-class of the class of the object being amended. Now that you know about types, you can start writing your first template. So far, you’ve written configurations with Pkl, either without a template, or using the AcmeCICD template from Amending templates. It is often easiest to first write a (typical) configuration for which you want to create a template. Suppose you want to define what a live workshop for this tutorial looks like. Consider this example: workshop2024.pkl title = \"Pkl: Configure your Systems in New Ways\" interactive = true seats = 100 occupancy = 0.85 duration = 1.5.h `abstract` = \"\"\" With more systems to configure, the software industry is drowning in repetitive and brittle configuration files. YAML and other configuration formats have been turned into programming languages against their will. Unsurprisingly, they don’t live up to the task. Pkl puts you back in control. \"\"\" event { name = \"Migrating Birds between hemispheres\" year = 2024 } instructors { \"Kate Sparrow\" \"Jerome Owl\" } sessions { new { date = \"2/1/2024\" time = 30.min } new { date = \"2/1/2024\" time = 30.min } } assistants { [\"kevin\"] = \"Kevin Parrot\" [\"betty\"] = \"Betty Harrier\" } agenda { [\"beginners\"] { name = \"Basic Configuration\" part = 1 duration = 45.min } [\"intermediates\"] { name = \"Filling out a Template\" part = 2 duration = 45.min } [\"experts\"] { name = \"Writing a Template\" part = 3 duration = 45.min } } Call your new template Workshop.pkl. Although not required, it’s good practice to always name your template with a module-clause. Defining the first few properties are like you saw in the previous section: module Workshop title: String interactive: Boolean seats: Int occupancy: Float duration: Duration `abstract`: String Unlike these first few properties, event is an object with multiple properties. To be able to type event, you need a class. You’ve seen before how to define this: class Event { name: String year: Int } event: Event Next, instructors isn’t an object with properties, but a list of unnamed values. Pkl offers the Listing type for this: instructors: Listing sessions is a Listing of objects, so you need a Session class. class Session { time: Duration date: String } sessions: Listing assistants has a structure like an object, in that all the values are named, but the set of names is not fixed for all possible workshops (and some workshops may have more assistants than others). The Pkl type for this is a Mapping: assistants: Mapping Finally, for every workshop session, there is an agenda, which describes which TutorialParts are covered. You already defined TutorialPart.pkl as its own module, so you should not define a separate class, but rather import that module and reuse it here: import \"TutorialPart.pkl\" (1) agenda: Mapping 1 This import clause brings the name TutorialPart into scope, which is the module class as discussed above. Note that import clauses must appear before property definitions. Putting it all together, your Workshop.pkl template looks like this: Workshop.pkl module Workshop import \"TutorialPart.pkl\" title: String interactive: Boolean seats: Int occupancy: Float duration: Duration `abstract`: String class Event { name: String year: Int } event: Event instructors: Listing class Session { time: Duration date: String } sessions: Listing assistants: Mapping agenda: Mapping 1. Although, some output formats can contain their own form of type annotation. This may be derived from the Pkl type. Type definitions (class and typealias) themselves are never rendered.","title":"Writing a Template","component":"main","version":"0.27.1","name":"03_writing_a_template","url":"/main/current/language-tutorial/03_writing_a_template.html","titles":[{"text":"Basic types","hash":"basic-types","id":1},{"text":"Typed objects, properties and amending","hash":"typed-objects-properties-and-amending","id":2},{"text":"A new template","hash":"a-new-template","id":3}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"Welcome to the Pkl tutorial.

For interactive development, the CLI includes a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL). The CLI comes in multiple flavors: Native macOS executable for amd64 (tested on macOS 10.15) Native Linux executable for amd64 Native Linux executable for aarch64 Native Alpine Linux executable for amd64 (cross-compiled and tested on Oracle Linux 8) Native Windows executable for amd64 (tested on Windows Server 2022) Java executable (tested with Java 17/21 on macOS and Oracle Linux) On macOS, Linux, and Windows, we recommend using the native executables. They are self-contained, start up instantly, and run complex Pkl code much faster than the Java executable. What is the Difference Between the Linux and Alpine Linux Executables? The Linux executable is dynamically linked against glibc and libstdc++, whereas, the Alpine Linux executable is statically linked against musl libc and libstdc++. The Java executable works on multiple platforms and has a smaller binary size than the native executables. However, it requires a Java 17 (or higher) runtime on the system path, has a noticeable startup delay, and runs complex Pkl code slower than the native executables. All flavors are built from the same codebase and undergo the same automated testing. Except where noted otherwise, the rest of this page discusses the native executables. On macOS and Linux, release versions can be installed with Homebrew. To install Pkl, run: brew install pkl To update Pkl, run: brew update brew upgrade pkl # or just `brew upgrade` Development and release versions can be downloaded and installed manually.

However, it will work as a jar, for example, with java -jar jpkl. Synopsis: pkl [] [] For a brief description of available options, run pkl -h. The Java executable is named jpkl. Synopsis: pkl eval [] [] Evaluate the given Pkl and produce their rendering results. The absolute or relative URIs of the modules to evaluate. Relative URIs are resolved against the working directory. -f, --format Default: (none) Example: yaml The output format to generate. The default output renderer for a module supports the following formats: json jsonnet pcf plist properties textproto xml yaml If no format is set, the default renderer chooses pcf. -o, --output-path Default: (none) Example: \"config.yaml\" The file path where the output file is placed. Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. This option is mutually exclusive with --multiple-file-output-path. If neither option is set, each module’s output.text is written to standard output. If multiple source modules are given, placeholders can be used to map them to different output files. The following placeholders are supported: %{moduleDir} The directory path of the module, relative to the working directory. Only available when evaluating file-based modules. %{moduleName} The simple module name as inferred from the module URI. For hierarchical URIs such as file:///foo/bar/baz.pkl, this is the last path segment without file extension. %{outputFormat} The requested output format. Only available if --format is set. If multiple source modules are mapped to the same output file, their outputs are concatenated. By default, module outputs are separated with ---, as in a YAML stream. The separator can be customized using the --module-output-separator option. --module-output-separator Default: --- (as in a YAML stream) The separator to use when multiple module outputs are written to the same file, or to standard output. -m, --multiple-file-output-path Default: (none) Example: \"output/\" The directory where a module’s output files are placed. Setting this option causes Pkl to evaluate a module’s output.files property and write the files specified therein. Within output.files, a key determines a file’s path relative to --multiple-file-output-path, and a value determines the file’s contents. This option cannot be used together with any of the following: --output-path --expression This option supports the same placeholders as --output-path. Examples: # Write files to `output/` pkl eval -m output/ myFiles.pkl # Write files to the current working directory pkl eval -m . myFiles.pkl # Write foo.pkl's files to the `foo` directory, and bar.pkl's files # to the `bar` directory pkl eval -m \"%{moduleName}\" foo.pkl bar.pkl For additional details, see Multiple File Output in the language reference. -x, --expression Default: (none) The expression to be evaluated within the module. This option causes Pkl to evaluate the provided expression instead of the module’s output.text or output.files properties. The resulting value is then stringified, and written to either standard out, or the designated output file. For example, consider the following Pkl module: pigeon.pkl metadata { species = \"Pigeon\" } The following command prints Pigeon to the console: pkl eval -x metadata.species pigeon.pkl # => Pigeon Setting an --expression flag can be thought of as substituting the expression in place of a module’s output.text property. Running the previous command is conceptually the same as if the below module were evaluated without the --expression flag: metadata { species = \"Pigeon\" } output { text = metadata.species.toString() } This command also takes common options. Synopsis: pkl server Run as a server that communicates over standard input/output. This option is used for embedding Pkl in an external client, such as pkl-swift or pkl-go. Synopsis: pkl test [] [] Evaluate the given as tests, producing a test report and appropriate exit code. Renderers defined in test files will be ignored by the test command. Tests that result in writing pkl-expected.pcf files are considered failing tests. If these are the only failures, the command exits with exit code 10. Otherwise, failures result in exit code 1. The absolute or relative URIs of the modules to test. Relative URIs are resolved against the working directory. --junit-reports Default: (none) Example: ./build/test-results Directory where to store JUnit reports. No JUnit reports will be generated if this option is not present. --overwrite Force generation of expected examples. The old expected files will be deleted if present. This command also takes common options. Synopsis: pkl repl [] Start a REPL session. This command takes common options. Synopsis: pkl project package This command prepares a project to be published as a package. Given a project directory, it creates the following artifacts: @ - the package metadata file @.sha256 - the dependency metadata file’s SHA-256 checksum @.zip - the package archive @.zip.sha256 - the package archive’s SHA-256 checksum These artifacts are expected to be published to an HTTPS server, such that the metadata and zip files can be fetched at their expected locations. The package ZIP should be available at the packageZipUrl location specified in the PklProject file The package metadata should be available at the package URI’s derived HTTPS URL. For example, given package package://example.com/mypackage@1.0.0, the metadata file should be published to https://example.com/mypackage@1.0.0. During packaging, this command runs these additional steps: Run the package’s API tests, if any are defined. Validates that if the package has already been published, that the package’s metadata is identical. This step can be skipped using the --skip-publish-check flag. Examples: # Search the current working directory for a project, and package it. pkl project package # Package all projects within the `packages/` directory to `.out`, writing each package's artifacts to its own directory. pkl project package --output-path \".out/%{name}@%{version}/\" packages/*/ --output-path Default: .out The directory to write artifacts to. Accepts the following placeholders: %{name} The name of the package %{version} The version of the package --skip-publish-check Skips checking whether a package has already been published with different contents. By default, the packager will check whether a package at the same version has already been published. If the package has been published, it validates that the package’s metadata is identical to the locally generated metadata. --junit-reports Default: (none) Example: ./build/test-results Directory where to store JUnit reports. No JUnit reports will be generated if this option is not present. --overwrite Force generation of expected examples. The old expected files will be deleted if present. This command also takes common options. Synopsis: pkl project resolve This command takes the dependencies of a project, and writes the resolved versions a file at path PklProject.deps.json. It builds a dependency list, taking the latest minor version in case of version conflicts. For more details, see the resolving dependencies section of the language reference. Examples: # Search the current working directory for a project, and resolve its dependencies. pkl project resolve # Resolve dependencies for all projects within the `packages/` directory. pkl project resolve packages/*/ This command accepts common options. Synopsis: pkl download-package This command downloads the specified packages to the cache directory. If the package already exists in the cache directory, this command is a no-op. This command accepts common options. Synopsis: pkl analyze imports [] This command builds a graph of imports declared in the provided modules. This is a lower level command that is meant to be useful for Pkl-related tooling. For example, this command feeds into the Gradle Plugin to determine if tasks are considered up-to-date or not. This command produces an object with two properties, imports and resolvedImports. The imports property is a mapping of a module’s absolute URI, to the set of imports declared within that module. The resolvedImports property is a mapping of a module’s absolute URI (as stated in imports), to the resolved absolute URI that might be useful for fetching the module’s contents. For example, a local dependency import will have an in-language URI with scheme projectpackage:, and may have resolved URI with scheme file: (assuming that the project is file-based). Examples: # Analyze the imports of a single module pkl analyze imports myModule.pkl # Same as the previous command, but output in JSON. pkl analyze imports -f json myModule.pkl # Analyze imports of all modules declared within src/ pkl analyze imports src/*.pkl The absolute or relative URIs of the modules to analyze. Relative URIs are resolved against the working directory. -f, --format Same meaning as -f, --format in pkl eval. -o, --output-path Same meaning as -o, --output-path in pkl eval. This command also takes common options. The pkl eval, pkl test, pkl repl, pkl project resolve, pkl project package, pkl download-package, and pkl analyze imports commands support the following common options: --allowed-modules Default: pkl:,file:,modulepath:,https:,repl:,package:,projectpackage: Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which modules can be loaded and evaluated. Patterns are matched against the beginning of module URIs. (File paths have been converted to file: URLs at this stage.) At least one pattern needs to match for a module to be loadable. --allowed-resources Default: env:,prop:,package:,projectpackage: Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which external resources can be read. Patterns are matched against the beginning of resource URIs. At least one pattern needs to match for a resource to be readable. --color Default: auto When to format messages with ANSI color codes. Possible values: \"never\": Never format \"auto\": Format if stdin, stdout, or stderr are connected to a console. \"always\": Always format --cache-dir Default: ~/.pkl/cache Example: /path/to/module/cache/ The cache directory for storing packages. --no-cache Disable caching of packages. -e, --env-var Default: OS environment variables for the current process Example: MY_VAR=myValue Sets an environment variable that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"env:\"). Repeat this option to set multiple environment variables. -h, --help Display help information. --module-path Default: (empty) Example: dir1:zip1.zip:jar1.jar Directories, ZIP archives, or JAR archives to search when resolving modulepath: URIs. Paths are separated by the platform-specific path separator (: on *nix, ; on Windows). Relative paths are resolved against the working directory. -p, --property Default: (none) Example: myProp=myValue Sets an external property that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"prop:\"). Repeat this option to set multiple external properties. --root-dir Default: (none) Example: /some/path Root directory for file: modules and resources. If set, access to file-based modules and resources is restricted to those located under the specified root directory. Any symlinks are resolved before this check is performed. --settings Default: (none) Example: mySettings.pkl File path of the Pkl settings file to use. If not set, ~/.pkl/settings.pkl or defaults specified in the pkl.settings standard library module are used. -t, --timeout Default: (none) Example: 30 Duration, in seconds, after which evaluation of a source module will be timed out. Note that a timeout is treated the same as a program error in that any subsequent source modules will not be evaluated. -v, --version Display version information. -w, --working-dir Base path that relative module paths passed as command-line arguments are resolved against. Defaults to the current working directory. --ca-certificates Default: (none) Example: /some/path/certificates.pem Path to a file containing CA certificates to be used for TLS connections. Setting this option replaces the existing set of CA certificates bundled into the CLI. Certificates need to be X.509 certificates in PEM format. For other methods of configuring certificates, see CA Certificates. --http-proxy Default: (none) Example: http://proxy.example.com:1234 Configures HTTP connections to connect to the provided proxy address. The URI must have scheme http, and may not contain anything other than a host and port. --http-no-proxy Default: (none) Example: example.com,169.254.0.0/16 Comma separated list of hosts to which all connections should bypass the proxy. Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation. The pkl eval, pkl test, pkl repl, pkl download-package, and pkl analyze imports commands also take the following options: --project-dir Default: (none) Example: /some/path Directory where the project lives. A project is a directory that contains a PklProject file, which is used to declare package dependencies, as well as common evaluator settings to be applied in the project. If omitted, this is determined by searching up from the working directory for a directory that contains a PklProject file, until --root-dir or the file system root is reached. --omit-project-settings Disables loading evaluator settings from the PklProject file. --no-project Disables all behavior related to projects. Say we have the following module: config.pkl bird { species = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" } parrot = (bird) { species = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Berries\" } To evaluate this module and write its output to standard output, run: pkl eval config.pkl You should see the following output: bird { species = \"Pigeon\" diet = \"Seeds\" } parrot { species = \"Parrot\" diet = \"Berries\" } To render output as JSON, YAML, XML property list, or Java properties, use --format json, --format yaml, --format plist, or --format properties, respectively. To control the output format from within Pkl code, see Module Output. To read a source module from standard input rather than a file, use - as a module name: echo mod2.pkl | pkl eval mod1.pkl - mod3.pkl This is especially useful in environments that don’t support /dev/stdin. To write output to a file rather than standard output, use --output-path some/file.ext. Multiple modules can be evaluated at once: pkl eval config1.pkl config2.pkl config3.pkl To write module outputs to separate output files, --output-path supports the following placeholders: %{moduleDir} the directory path of the source module, relative to the working directory (only available for file based modules) %{moduleName} the last path segment of the module URI, without file extension %{outputFormat} the target format (only available if --format is set) The following run produces three JSON files placed next to the given source modules: pkl eval --format=json --output-path=%{moduleDir}/%{moduleName}.json config1.pkl config2.pkl config3.pkl If multiple module outputs are written to the same file, or to standard output, their outputs are concatenated. By default, module outputs are separated with ---, as in a YAML stream. The separator can be customized using the --module-output-separator option. To start a REPL session, run pkl repl: $ pkl repl Welcome to Pkl 0.27.1. Type an expression to have it evaluated. Type :help or :examples for more information. pkl> The Java executable is named jpkl. To load config.pkl into the REPL, run: pkl> :load config.pkl To evaluate the bird.species property, run: pkl> bird.species \"Pigeon\" To evaluate the entire module, force-evaluate this: pkl> :force this Commands start with : and can be tab-completed: pkl> :Tab clear examples force help load quit reset pkl> :qTab pkl> :quitReturn $ Commands can be abbreviated with any unique name prefix: pkl> :qReturn $ To learn more about each command, run the :help command. Some commands support further command-specific tab completion. For example, the :load command supports completing file paths. With commands out of the way, let’s move on to evaluating code. To evaluate an expression, type the expression and hit Return. pkl> 2 + 4 6 Apart from expressions, the REPL also accepts property, function, and class definitions. (See the Language Reference to learn more about these language concepts.) pkl> hello = \"Hello, World!\" pkl> hello \"Hello, World!\" pkl> function double(n) = 2 * n pkl> double(5) 10 pkl> class Bird { species: String } pkl> new Bird { species = \"Pigeon\" } { name = ? } Top-level expressions are only supported in the REPL. In a regular module, every expression is contained in a definition, and only definitions exist at the top level. Existing members can be redefined: pkl> species = \"Pigeon\" pkl> species \"Pigeon\" pkl> species = \"Barn\" pkl> species \"Barn\" pkl> species + \" Owl\" pkl> species \"Barn Owl\" Due to Pkl’s late binding semantics, redefining a member affects dependent members: pkl> name = \"Barn\" pkl> species = \"\\(name) Owl\" pkl> species \"Barn Owl\" pkl> name = \"Elf\" pkl> species \"Elf Owl\" Redefining members is only supported in the REPL. Under the hood, it works as follows: The REPL environment is represented as a synthetic Pkl module. When a new member is defined, it is added to the current REPL module. When an existing member is redefined, it is added to a new REPL module that amends the previous REPL module. The Pkl settings file allows to customize the CLI experience. A settings file is a Pkl module amending the pkl.settings standard library module. Its default location is ~/.pkl/settings.pkl. To use a different settings file, set the --settings command line option, for example --settings mysettings.pkl. To enforce default settings, use --settings pkl:settings. The settings file is also honored by (and configurable through) the Gradle plugin and CliEvaluator API. Here is a typical settings file: ~/.pkl/settings.pkl amends \"pkl:settings\" (1) editor = Idea (2) 1 A settings file should amend the pkl.settings standard library module. 2 Configures IntelliJ IDEA as the preferred editor. Other supported values are System, GoLand, TextMate, Sublime, Atom, and VsCode. With the above settings file in place, Cmd+Double-clicking a source code link in a stack trace opens the corresponding file in IntelliJ IDEA at the correct location. To learn more about available settings, see pkl.settings. When making TLS requests, Pkl comes with its own set of CA certificates. These certificates can be overridden via either of the two options: Set them directly via the CLI option --ca-certificates . Add them to a directory at path ~/.pkl/cacerts/. Both these options will replace the default CA certificates bundled with Pkl. The CLI option takes precedence over the certificates in ~/.pkl/cacerts/. Certificates need to be X.509 certificates in PEM format. When making HTTP(s) requests, Pkl can possibly make use of an HTTP proxy. There are two values that determine proxy settings; the proxy address and list of noproxy rules. When determining proxy settings, Pkl will look at the following locations, in order of precedence (lowest to highest): OS settings (on macOS, Windows, and GNOME environments) Settings file PklProject file --http-proxy and --http-no-proxy CLI flags The proxy and noproxy values are individually set. For example, using the --http-no-proxy flag but not the --http-proxy flag will cause Pkl to look at the PklProject file, then the settings file, then system settings for the proxy address. One exception to this rule is that setting a proxy address will cause Pkl to ignore any noproxy values set at the OS level. Pkl only supports HTTP proxies, so neither HTTPS nor SOCKS proxies are supported. Pkl does not support authentication with a proxy. When specifying a proxy address, it must have scheme http, and may not contain anything other than a host and port. Pkl can be configured to bypass the proxy for specific requests via a proxy exclusion rule (i.e. the --http-no-proxy flag). It may be provided either as a hostname, an IP address, or an IP range via CIDR notation. When determining whether a proxy should be excluded, hostnames do not get resolved to their IP address. For example, a request to localhost will not match --http-no-proxy=127.0.0.1. For individual hosts (not CIDRs), ports can be specified. When no port is specified for a given host, connections to all ports bypass the proxy. A hostname will match all of its subdomains. For example, example.com will match foo.example.com, and bar.foo.example.com, but not fooexample.com. The value * is a special wildcard that matches all hosts. A port can optionally be specified. If omitted, it matches all ports. Pkl follows the rules described in Standardizing no_proxy, except it does not look at environment variables.","title":"CLI","component":"main","version":"0.27.1","name":"index","url":"/main/current/pkl-cli/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"installation","id":1},{"text":"Homebrew","hash":"homebrew","id":2},{"text":"Download","hash":"download","id":3},{"text":"macOS Executable","hash":"macos-executable","id":4},{"text":"Linux Executable","hash":"linux-executable","id":5},{"text":"Alpine Linux Executable","hash":"alpine-linux-executable","id":6},{"text":"Windows Executable","hash":"windows-executable","id":7},{"text":"Java Executable","hash":"java-executable","id":8},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage","id":9},{"text":"pkl eval","hash":"command-eval","id":10},{"text":"Options","hash":"options","id":11},{"text":"pkl server","hash":"command-server","id":12},{"text":"pkl test","hash":"command-test","id":13},{"text":"Options","hash":"options-2","id":14},{"text":"pkl repl","hash":"command-repl","id":15},{"text":"pkl project package","hash":"command-project-package","id":16},{"text":"Options","hash":"options-3","id":17},{"text":"pkl project resolve","hash":"command-project-resolve","id":18},{"text":"Options","hash":"options-4","id":19},{"text":"pkl download-package","hash":"command-download-package","id":20},{"text":"Options","hash":"options-5","id":21},{"text":"pkl analyze imports","hash":"command-analyze-imports","id":22},{"text":"Options","hash":"options-6","id":23},{"text":"Common options","hash":"common-options","id":24},{"text":"Evaluating Modules","hash":"evaluating-modules","id":25},{"text":"Batch Evaluation","hash":"batch-evaluation","id":26},{"text":"Working with the REPL","hash":"repl","id":27},{"text":"Loading Modules","hash":"loading-modules","id":28},{"text":"REPL Commands","hash":"repl-commands","id":29},{"text":"Evaluating Code","hash":"evaluating-code","id":30},{"text":"Redefining Members","hash":"redefining-members","id":31},{"text":"Settings File","hash":"settings-file","id":32},{"text":"CA Certificates","hash":"ca-certs","id":33},{"text":"HTTP Proxying","hash":"http-proxy","id":34},{"text":"Proxy exclusions","hash":"proxy-exclusions","id":35}]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"The pkl-core library contains the Pkl parser, evaluator, REPL server, and Standard Library. It is the foundation for most of Pkl’s other libraries and tools. The library can also be used to embed Pkl in Java libraries and applications. The pkl-core library is available from Maven Central. It requires Java 17 or higher. To use the library in a Gradle project, declare the following dependency: Kotlin Groovy build.gradle.kts dependencies { implementation(\"org.pkl-lang:pkl-core:0.27.1\") } repositories { mavenCentral() } build.gradle dependencies { implementation \"org.pkl-lang:pkl-core:0.27.1\" } repositories { mavenCentral() } To use the library in a Maven project, declare the following dependency: pom.xml org.pkl-lang pkl-core 0.27.1 Evaluator is the core evaluator that exposes multiple methods of evaluation. The main evaluation method is evaluate, which returns a Java representation of the Pkl module object. If evaluation succeeds, a PModule object representing the fully evaluated module is returned. Otherwise, an PklException with error details is thrown. Let’s look at an example: PModule module; try (var evaluator = Evaluator.preconfigured()) { (1) module = evaluator.evaluate( ModuleSource.text(\"pigeon { age = 30; hobbies = List(\\\"swimming\\\", \\\"surfing\\\") }\")); (2) } var pigeon = (PObject) module.get(\"pigeon\"); (3) var className = pigeon.getClassInfo().getQualifiedName(); (4) var hobbies = (List) pigeon.get(\"hobbies\"); (5) 1 Build an Evaluator with default configuration. The evaluator should be closed once it is no longer needed. In this example, this is done with a try-with-resources statement. Note that objects returned by the evaluator remain valid after calling close(). 2 Build a ModuleSource using the given text as the module’s contents. Evaluate the given module source. Alternatively, it’s possible to build a ModuleSource from a file, path, uri, and other sources. 3 Get the module’s \"pigeon\" property, which is represented as PObject in Java. 4 Get the class name for this object. In this example, the class name is pkl.base#Dynamic. 5 Get pigeon’s \"diet\" property, which is represented as List in Java. Often, ValueVisitor is a better way to process a module. See PcfRenderer, JsonRenderer, YamlRenderer and PListRenderer for examples. The (Pkl, not Java) security manager can be configured and customized using SecurityManagers and related classes. Module loaders can be configured and customized using ModuleKeyFactories and related classes.

Pkldoc’s look and feel is inspired by Scaladoc. To get a first impression, browse the Standard Library API Docs. Pkldoc offers the following features: Code navigation Easily navigate between hyperlinked modules, classes, functions, and properties. Member search Search the entire documentation by member name. See the next section for details. Comment folding Expand and collapse multi-paragraph doc comments. Markdown support Write doc comments in Markdown. See Doc Comments for details. Member links Link to other members from your doc comments. See Member Links for details. Member anchors Get a member’s deep link by clicking its anchor symbol and copying the URL in the address bar. Cross-site links Enable cross-site member links simply by providing the URLs of other Pkldoc websites such as the standard library docs. To get a first impression of Pkldoc’s member search, let’s try and find property MinFiniteFloat in the standard library docs: Figure 1. Searching the standard library docs. To start a search, press s. Search results are displayed as you type. To limit the search to a particular kind of member, prefix the search term with m: for modules, c: for classes, f: for functions, or p: for properties. For example, search term p:min finds property MinFiniteFloat but not function min(). Camel case matching is always enabled and does not require capitalizing the search term. For example, search term mff matches properties MinFiniteFloat and MaxFiniteFloat. Both search terms and member names may contain non-ASCII Unicode characters. As characters are normalized to their base form, search term res matches Réseau. The @AlsoKnownAs annotation, defined and used throughout the pkl.base module, documents alternative names for a member used in other programming languages or earlier versions of a module. Pkldoc’s search takes these alternative names into account. For example, searching the standard library docs for count or size finds property String.length. Feel free to use @AlsoKnownAs in your own modules. Search results are categorized into exact and other (partial) matches. On module and class pages, additional categories show matches in the same module and class. Within a category, results are ranked by similarity with the search term. To navigate to a search result, either click the result or select it with the up/down arrow keys and press Enter. Pkldoc is offered as Gradle plugin, Java library, and CLI. See Installation in the Gradle Plugin chapter. The pkl-doc library is available from Maven Central. It requires Java 17 or higher. To use the library in a Gradle project, declare the following dependency: Kotlin Groovy build.gradle.kts dependencies { implementation(\"org.pkl-lang:pkl-doc:0.27.1\") } repositories { mavenCentral() } build.gradle dependencies { implementation \"org.pkl-lang:pkl-doc:0.27.1\" } repositories { mavenCentral() } To use the library in a Maven project, declare the following dependency: pom.xml org.pkl-lang pkl-doc 0.27.1 The CLI is bundled with the library and does not currently ship as a native executable or a self-contained Jar. We recommend to provision it with a Maven compatible build tool as shown in Library Installation. The Pkldoc tool is offered as Gradle plugin, Java library, and CLI. It can generate documentation either for modules directly, or generate documentation for package uris. The tool requires an argument of a module named docsite-info.pkl, that amends pkl.DocsiteInfo. Modules can be passed directly to Pkldoc for documentation generation. When generating documentation for these modules, there must also be a module named doc-package-info.pkl that amends pkl.DocPackageInfo. The doc-package-info.pkl module defines a doc package, which describes how modules are grouped and versioned together. When generating documentation for modules, each such module must declare a module name that starts with a package name declared in a doc-package-info.pkl module. For example, the following are valid module declarations for package com.example: module com.example.Birds module com.example.Birds.Parrot The part of the module name that comes after the package name must match the module’s relative path in its source code repository. For example, module com.example.Bird.Parrot is expected to be found at $sourceCode/Bird/Parrot.pkl, where sourceCode is configured in doc-package-info.pkl. Pkldoc can alternatively generate documentation for a package. When generating documentation for a package, the URI of the package must be passed as an argument to Pkldoc. These packages must already be published and downloadable. When generating documentation for packages, modules within a package must declare a module name that is prefixed by the package’s name declared in the Package.name property of its PklProject file. For example, the following are valid module declarations for package com.example: module com.example.Birds module com.example.Birds.Parrot The part of the module name that comes after the package name must match the module’s relative path in its source code repository. For example, module com.example.Bird.Parrot is expected to be found at $sourceCode/Bird/Parrot.pkl, where sourceCode is configured in the Package.sourceCode property of its PklProject file. See Pkldoc Generation in the Gradle Plugin chapter. The Java library offers two APIs: A high-level CliDocGenerator API whose feature set corresponds to the CLI. A low-level DocGenerator API that offers additional features and control. For more information, refer to the Javadoc documentation. As mentioned in CLI Installation, the CLI is bundled with the library. To run the CLI, execute the library Jar or its org.pkl.doc.Main class. Synopsis: java -cp -jar pkl-doc.jar [] The absolute or relative URIs of docsite descriptors, package descriptors, and the modules for which to generate documentation. Relative URIs are resolved against the working directory. -o, --output-dir Default: (none) Example: pkldoc The directory where generated documentation is placed. Common CLI options: --allowed-modules Default: pkl:,file:,modulepath:,https:,repl:,package:,projectpackage: Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which modules can be loaded and evaluated. Patterns are matched against the beginning of module URIs. (File paths have been converted to file: URLs at this stage.) At least one pattern needs to match for a module to be loadable. --allowed-resources Default: env:,prop:,package:,projectpackage: Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which external resources can be read. Patterns are matched against the beginning of resource URIs. At least one pattern needs to match for a resource to be readable. --color Default: auto When to format messages with ANSI color codes. Possible values: \"never\": Never format \"auto\": Format if stdin, stdout, or stderr are connected to a console. \"always\": Always format --cache-dir Default: ~/.pkl/cache Example: /path/to/module/cache/ The cache directory for storing packages. --no-cache Disable caching of packages. -e, --env-var Default: OS environment variables for the current process Example: MY_VAR=myValue Sets an environment variable that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"env:\"). Repeat this option to set multiple environment variables. -h, --help Display help information. --module-path Default: (empty) Example: dir1:zip1.zip:jar1.jar Directories, ZIP archives, or JAR archives to search when resolving modulepath: URIs. Paths are separated by the platform-specific path separator (: on *nix, ; on Windows). Relative paths are resolved against the working directory. -p, --property Default: (none) Example: myProp=myValue Sets an external property that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"prop:\"). Repeat this option to set multiple external properties. --root-dir Default: (none) Example: /some/path Root directory for file: modules and resources. If set, access to file-based modules and resources is restricted to those located under the specified root directory. Any symlinks are resolved before this check is performed. --settings Default: (none) Example: mySettings.pkl File path of the Pkl settings file to use. If not set, ~/.pkl/settings.pkl or defaults specified in the pkl.settings standard library module are used. -t, --timeout Default: (none) Example: 30 Duration, in seconds, after which evaluation of a source module will be timed out. Note that a timeout is treated the same as a program error in that any subsequent source modules will not be evaluated. -v, --version Display version information. -w, --working-dir Base path that relative module paths passed as command-line arguments are resolved against. Defaults to the current working directory. --ca-certificates Default: (none) Example: /some/path/certificates.pem Path to a file containing CA certificates to be used for TLS connections. Setting this option replaces the existing set of CA certificates bundled into the CLI. Certificates need to be X.509 certificates in PEM format. For other methods of configuring certificates, see CA Certificates. --http-proxy Default: (none) Example: http://proxy.example.com:1234 Configures HTTP connections to connect to the provided proxy address. The URI must have scheme http, and may not contain anything other than a host and port. --http-no-proxy Default: (none) Example: example.com,169.254.0.0/16 Comma separated list of hosts to which all connections should bypass the proxy. Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation.

That is, plugin version x.y.z uses Pkl version x.y.z. The Gradle plugin is available from Maven Central. It requires Java 17 or higher and Gradle 8.1 or higher. Earlier Gradle versions are not supported. The plugin is applied as follows: Kotlin Groovy build.gradle.kts plugins { id(\"org.pkl-lang\") version \"0.27.1\" } settings.gradle.kts pluginManagement { repositories { mavenCentral() } } build.gradle plugins { id \"org.pkl-lang\" version \"0.27.1\" } settings.gradle pluginManagement { repositories { mavenCentral() } } This feature integrates the Pkl evaluator into Gradle builds. To add an evaluator to the build, add a named configuration block inside pkl.evaluators: build.gradle build.gradle.kts pkl { evaluators { evalPkl { sourceModules.add(file(\"module1.pkl\")) outputFile = layout.buildDirectory.file(\"module1.yaml\") outputFormat = \"yaml\" } } } pkl { evaluators { register(\"evalPkl\") { sourceModules.add(file(\"module1.pkl\")) outputFile.set(layout.buildDirectory.file(\"module1.yaml\")) outputFormat.set(\"yaml\") } } } For each declared evaluator, the Pkl plugin creates an equally named task. Hence the above evaluator can be run with: $ ./gradlew evalPkl For a ready-to-go example with full source code, see codegen-java in the pkl/pkl-examples repository. outputFormat: Property Default: \"pcf\" Example: outputFormat = \"yaml\" The output format to generate. The default output renderer for a module supports the following formats: \"json\" \"jsonnet\" \"pcf\" \"plist\" \"properties\" \"textproto\" \"xml\" \"yaml\" outputFile: RegularFileProperty Default: file(\"%{moduleDir}/%{moduleName}.%{outputFormat}\") (places output files next to the source modules) Example: outputFile = layout.projectDirectory.file(\"config.yaml\") The file path where the output file is placed. Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. If multiple source modules are given, placeholders can be used to map them to different output files. The following placeholders are supported: %{moduleDir} The directory path of the module, relative to the working directory. Only available when evaluating file-based modules. %{moduleName} The simple module name as inferred from the module URI. For hierarchical module URIs such as file:///foo/bar/baz.pkl, this is the last path segment without file extension. %{outputFormat} The requested output format. Only available if outputFormat is set. If multiple sources modules are mapped to the same output file, their outputs are concatenated. By default, module outputs are separated with ---, as in a YAML stream. The separator can be customized using the moduleOutputSeparator option. multipleFileOutputDir: DirectoryProperty Example 1: multipleFileOutputDir = layout.projectDirectory.dir(\"output\") Example 2: multipleFileOutputDir = layout.projectDirectory.file(\"%{moduleDir}/output\") The directory where a module’s output files are placed. Setting this option causes Pkl to evaluate a module’s output.files property and write the files specified therein. Within output.files, a key determines a file’s path relative to multipleFileOutputDir, and a value determines the file’s contents. This option cannot be used together with any of the following: outputFile expression This option supports the same placeholders as outputFile. For additional details, see Multiple File Output in the language reference. moduleOutputSeparator: Property Default: \"---\" (as in a YAML stream) The separator to use when multiple module outputs are written to the same file. expression: Property Default: (none) Example: expression = \"topLevelProperty.subValue\" The expression to be evaluated within the module. This option causes Pkl to evaluate the provided expression instead of the module’s output.text or output.files properties. The resulting value is then stringified, and written to the designated output file. For example, consider the following Pkl module: my-pod.pkl metadata { name = \"my-pod\" } The expression metadata.name evaluates to text my-pod.

Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. proxy: Property Default: null Example: proxy = uri(\"http://proxy.example.com:1234\") Configures HTTP connections to connect to the provided proxy address. The URI must have scheme http, and may not contain anything other than a host and port. noProxy: ListProperty Default: null Example: noProxy = [\"example.com\", \"169.254.0.0/16\"] Hosts to which all connections should bypass the proxy. Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation. This feature integrates the Pkl test evaluator into Gradle builds. To add tests to the build, add a named configuration block inside pkl.tests: build.gradle build.gradle.kts pkl { tests { testPkl { sourceModules.add(files(\"module1_test.pkl\", \"module2_test.pkl\")) junitReportsDir = layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"reports\") overwrite = false } } } pkl { tests { register(\"testPkl\") { sourceModules.addAll(files(\"module1_test.pkl\", \"module2_test.pkl\")) junitReportsDir.set(layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"reports\")) overwrite.set(false) } } } junitReportsDir: DirectoryProperty Default: null Example: junitReportsDir = layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"reports\") Whether and where to generate JUnit XML reports. overwrite: Property Default: false Whether to ignore expected example files and generate them again.

To add a Java code generator to the build, add a named configuration block inside pkl.javaCodeGenerators: build.gradle build.gradle.kts pkl { javaCodeGenerators { genJava { sourceModules.addAll(files(\"Template1.pkl\", \"Template2.pkl\")) } } } pkl { javaCodeGenerators { register(\"genJava\") { sourceModules.addAll(files(\"Template1.pkl\", \"Template2.pkl\")) } } } To compile generated classes together with test code rather than main code, use sourceSet = sourceSets.test. To generate getter methods instead of public final fields, use generateGetters = true. For each declared Java code generator, the Pkl plugin creates an equally named task. Hence, the above generator can be run with: $ ./gradlew genJava For a ready-to-go example with full source code, see codegen-java in the pkl/pkl-examples repository. generateGetters: Property Default: false Example: generateGetters = true Whether to generate private final fields and public getter methods rather than public final fields. preferJavaxInjectAnnotation: Boolean Default: false Example: preferJavaxInjectAnnotation = true Whether to annotate constructor parameters with @javax.inject.Named instead of @org.pkl.config.java.mapper.Named. If true, the generated code will have a compile dependency on javax.inject:javax.inject:1. Common code generation properties: indent: Property Default: \" \" (two spaces) Example: indent = \"\\t\" (one tab) The characters to use for indenting generated source code. outputDir: DirectoryProperty Default: layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"generated/pkl/\") Example: outputDir = layout.projectDirectory.dir(\"src/main/pkl\") The directory where generated classes are placed. The default places generated sources within the build directory of the project, to avoid sources from being committed into the repository on accident. sourceSet: Property Default: sourceSets.main (if it exists; no default otherwise) Example: sourceSet = sourceSets.test The Gradle source set that generated code is compiled together with. For the codegen tasks, the modulePath property defaults to the compilation classpath of this source set, as well as all of the source directories of the resource source directory set of this source set. This setup makes it possible to rely on modules defined in classpath dependencies of your project or in the resources of your project. For projects which apply the idea plugin and are opened in IntelliJ IDEA, this option determines whether generated sources are marked as test sources (if the source set’s name contains the word \"test\") or regular sources (otherwise). generateSpringBootConfig: Property Default: false Example: generateSpringBootConfig = true Whether to generate config classes for use with Spring Boot. renames: MapProperty Default: [:] Example: renames = [\"foo.\": \"com.example.foo.\", \"bar.Config\": \"com.example.bar.Config\"] Allows to change default class and package names (derived from Pkl module names) in the generated code. When you need the generated class or package names to be different from the default names derived from the Pkl module names, you can define a rename mapping, where the key is the original Pkl module name prefix, and the value is its replacement. When you do, the generated code’s package declarations, class names, as well as file locations, will be modified according to this mapping. The prefixes are replaced literally, which means that dots at the end are important. If you want to rename packages only, in most cases, you must ensure that you have an ending dot on both sides of a mapping (except for an empty mapping, if you use it), otherwise you may get unexpected results: // Assuming the following mapping configuration: renames = [ \"com.foo.\": \"x\", // Dot on the left only \"org.bar\": \"y.\", // Dot on the right only \"net.baz\": \"z\" // No dots ] // The following renames will be made: \"com.foo.bar\" -> \"xbar\" // Target prefix merged into the suffix \"org.bar.baz\" -> \"y..baz\" // Double dot, invalid name \"net.baz.qux\" -> \"z.qux\" // Looks okay, but... \"net.bazqux\" -> \"zqux\" // ...may cut the name in the middle. When computing the appropriate target name, the longest matching prefix is used: // Assuming the following mapping configuration: renames = [ \"com.foo.Main\": \"w.Main\", \"com.foo.\": \"x.\", \"com.\": \"y.\", \"\": \"z.\" ] // The following renames will be made: com.foo.Main -> w.Main com.foo.bar -> x.bar com.baz.qux -> y.baz.qux org.foo.bar -> z.org.foo.bar Keys in this mapping can be arbitrary strings, including an empty string. Values must be valid dot-separated fully qualifed class name prefixes, possibly terminated by a dot. Common properties: sourceModules: ListProperty Default: [] Example 1: sourceModules = [\"module1.pkl\", \"module2.pkl\"] Example 2: sourceModules = fileTree(\"config\").include(\"**/*.pkl\") List of Pkl modules which are used for this operation. This property accepts the following types to represent a module: java.net.URI java.io.File java.nio.file.Path java.net.URL java.lang.CharSequence - if the represented string looks like a URI (it contains a scheme), the input is treated as a URI. Otherwise, it is treated as a path. Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. org.gradle.api.file.FileSystemLocation transitiveModules: ConfigurableFileCollection Default: [computed by pkl-gradle] Example 1: transitiveModules.from files(\"module1.pkl\", \"module2.pkl\") Example 2: transitiveModules.from fileTree(\"config\").include(\"**/*.pkl\") File paths of modules that are directly or indirectly used by source modules. This property, along with sourceModules, is the set of input files used to determine whether this task is up-to-date or not. By default, Pkl computes this property by analyzing the imports of the source modules. Setting this property explicitly causes Pkl to skip the analyze imports step. Including source modules in transitiveModules is permitted but not required. Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. projectDir: DirectoryProperty Default: null Example 1: projectDir = layout.projectDirectory.dir(\"pkl\") Example 2: projectDir.fileValue file(\"/some/absolute/path\") Directory where the project lives. A project is a directory that contains a PklProject file, which is used to declare package dependencies, as well as common evaluator settings to be applied in the project. If null, this is determined by searching up from the working directory for a directory that contains a PklProject file, until evalRootDir or the file system root is reached. omitProjectSettings: Property Disables loading evaluator settings from the PklProject file. noProject: Property Disables all behavior related to projects. settingsModule: Property Default: null Example: settingsModule = layout.projectDirectory.file(\"mySettings.pkl\") The Pkl settings module to use. This property accepts the same input types as the sourceModules property. If null, ~/.pkl/settings.pkl or defaults specified in the pkl.settings standard library module are used. allowedModules: ListProperty Default: [\"pkl:\", \"file:\", \"modulepath:\", \"https:\", \"repl:\", \"package:\", \"projectpackage:\"] Example: allowedModules = [\"file:\"] URI patterns that determine which modules can be loaded and evaluated. Patterns are matched against the beginning of module URIs. (File paths have been converted to file: URLs at this stage.) At least one pattern needs to match for a module to be loadable. allowedResources: ListProperty Default: [\"env:\", \"prop:\", \"modulepath:\", \"https:\", \"file:\", \"package:\", \"projectpackage:\"] Example: allowedResources = [\"env:\", \"prop:\"] URL patterns that determine which external resources can be read. Patterns are matched against the beginning of resource URLs. At least one pattern needs to match for a resource to be readable. environmentVariables: MapProperty Default: [:] (note that Gradle default differs from CLI default) Example 1: environmentVariables = [\"MY_VAR_1\": \"myValue1\", \"MY_VAR_2\": \"myValue2\"] Example 2: environmentVariables = System.getenv() Environment variables that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"env:\"). evalRootDir: DirectoryProperty Default: rootProject.layout.projectDirectory Example 1: evalRootDir = layout.projectDirectory.dir(\"pkl-modules\") Example 2: evalRootDir.fileValue file(\"/some/absolute/path\") Root directory for file: modules and resources. If non-null, access to file-based modules and resources is restricted to those located under the root directory. Any symlinks are resolved before this check is performed. evalTimeout: Property Default: null Example: evalTimeout = Duration.ofSeconds(10) Duration after which evaluation of a source module will be timed out. Note that a timeout is treated the same as a program error in that any subsequent source modules will not be evaluated. externalProperties: MapProperty Default: [:] Example: externalProperties = [\"myProp1\": \"myValue1\", \"myProp2\": \"myValue2\"] External properties that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"prop:\"). moduleCacheDir: DirectoryProperty Default: null Example 1: moduleCacheDir = layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"pkl-module-cache\") Example 2: moduleCacheDir.fileValue file(\"/absolute/path/to/cache\") The cache directory for storing packages. If null, defaults to ~/.pkl/cache. color: Property Default: false Format messages using ANSI color. noCache: Property Default: false Disable caching of packages. modulePath: ConfigurableFileCollection Default: files() (empty collection) Example: modulePath.from files(\"dir1\", \"zip1.zip\", \"jar1.jar\") The directories, ZIP archives, or JAR archives to search when resolving modulepath: URIs. Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. proxy: Property Default: null Example: proxy = uri(\"http://proxy.example.com:1234\") Configures HTTP connections to connect to the provided proxy address. The URI must have scheme http, and may not contain anything other than a host and port. noProxy: ListProperty Default: null Example: noProxy = [\"example.com\", \"169.254.0.0/16\"] Hosts to which all connections should bypass the proxy. Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation. This feature integrates the Kotlin code generator into Gradle builds. To add a Kotlin code generator to the build, add a named configuration block inside pkl.kotlinCodeGenerators: build.gradle build.gradle.kts pkl { kotlinCodeGenerators { genKotlin { sourceModules.addAll(files(\"Template1.pkl\", \"Template2.pkl\")) } } } pkl { kotlinCodeGenerators { register(\"genKotlin\") { sourceModules.addAll(files(\"Template1.pkl\", \"Template2.pkl\")) } } } To compile generated classes together with test code rather than main code, use sourceSet = sourceSets.test. For each declared Kotlin code generator, the Pkl plugin creates an equally named task. Hence the above generator can be run with: $ ./gradlew genKotlin For a ready-to-go example with full source code, see codegen-kotlin in the pkl/pkl-examples repository. (None) Common code generation properties: indent: Property Default: \" \" (two spaces) Example: indent = \"\\t\" (one tab) The characters to use for indenting generated source code. outputDir: DirectoryProperty Default: layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"generated/pkl/\") Example: outputDir = layout.projectDirectory.dir(\"src/main/pkl\") The directory where generated classes are placed. The default places generated sources within the build directory of the project, to avoid sources from being committed into the repository on accident. sourceSet: Property Default: sourceSets.main (if it exists; no default otherwise) Example: sourceSet = sourceSets.test The Gradle source set that generated code is compiled together with.

To add a Pkldoc generator to the build, add a named configuration block inside pkl.pkldocGenerators: build.gradle build.gradle.kts pkl { pkldocGenerators { pkldoc { sourceModules.addAll(files(\"doc-package-info.pkl\", \"Template1.pkl\", \"Template2.pkl\")) } } } pkl { pkldocGenerators { register(\"pkldoc\") { sourceModules.addAll(files(\"doc-package-info.pkl\", \"Template1.pkl\", \"Template2.pkl\")) } } } For each declared Pkldoc generator, the Pkl plugin creates an equally named task. Hence, the above generator can be run with: $ ./gradlew pkldoc For a ready-to-go example with full source code, see pkldoc in the pkl/pkl-examples repository. The following properties can be configured inside a Pkldoc generator’s configuration block: outputDir: DirectoryProperty Default: layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"pkldoc/\") Example: outputDir = layout.projectDirectory.dir(\"pkl-docs\") The directory where generated documentation is placed. Common properties: sourceModules: ListProperty Default: [] Example 1: sourceModules = [\"module1.pkl\", \"module2.pkl\"] Example 2: sourceModules = fileTree(\"config\").include(\"**/*.pkl\") List of Pkl modules which are used for this operation.

Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation. This feature is the Gradle analogy for the project package command in the CLI. It prepares package assets to be published from a project. There are two differences between this feature and the CLI: Input project directories are required (the CLI determines a project from the current working directory if arguments are omitted). Output directory defaults to a path within the build directory. build.gradle build.gradle.kts pkl { project { packagers { makePackages { projectDirectories.from(file(\"pkl-config/\")) } } } } pkl { project { packagers { register(\"makePackages\") { projectDirectories.from(file(\"pkl-config/\")) } } } } For each declared packager, the Pkl plugin creates an equally named task. Hence, the above packager can be run with: $ ./gradlew makePackages projectDirectories: ConfigurableFileCollection Default: (none) Example: projectDirectories.from(file(\"pkl-config/\"\")) The project directories to create packages for. skipPublishCheck: Property Default: (false) Example: skipPublishCheck.set(true) Skips checking whether a package has already been published with different contents. By default, the packager will check whether a package at the same version has already been published. If the package has been published, it validates that the package’s metadata is identical to the locally generated metadata. outputPath: DirectoryProperty Default: project.getLayout().getBuildDirectory().dir(\"generated/pkl/packages\") The directory to write artifacts to. Accepts the following placeholders: %{name} The name of the package %{version} The version of the package junitReportsDir: DirectoryProperty Default: null Example: junitReportsDir = layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"reports\") Whether and where to generate JUnit XML reports. overwrite: Property Default: false Whether to ignore expected example files and generate them again.

Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation. This feature is the Gradle analogy for the project resolve command in the CLI. It takes the dependencies of a project, and writes the resolved versions a file at path PklProject.deps.json, within the root directory of the project. build.gradle build.gradle.kts pkl { project { resolvers { resolvePklDeps { projectDirectories.from(file(\"pkl-config/\")) } } } } pkl { project { resolvers { register(\"resolvePklDeps\") { projectDirectories.from(file(\"pkl-config/\")) } } } } For each declared resolver, the Pkl plugin creates an equally named task.

Note that a timeout is treated the same as a program error in that any subsequent source modules will not be evaluated. externalProperties: MapProperty Default: [:] Example: externalProperties = [\"myProp1\": \"myValue1\", \"myProp2\": \"myValue2\"] External properties that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"prop:\"). moduleCacheDir: DirectoryProperty Default: null Example 1: moduleCacheDir = layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"pkl-module-cache\") Example 2: moduleCacheDir.fileValue file(\"/absolute/path/to/cache\") The cache directory for storing packages. If null, defaults to ~/.pkl/cache. color: Property Default: false Format messages using ANSI color. noCache: Property Default: false Disable caching of packages. modulePath: ConfigurableFileCollection Default: files() (empty collection) Example: modulePath.from files(\"dir1\", \"zip1.zip\", \"jar1.jar\") The directories, ZIP archives, or JAR archives to search when resolving modulepath: URIs. Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. proxy: Property Default: null Example: proxy = uri(\"http://proxy.example.com:1234\") Configures HTTP connections to connect to the provided proxy address. The URI must have scheme http, and may not contain anything other than a host and port. noProxy: ListProperty Default: null Example: noProxy = [\"example.com\", \"169.254.0.0/16\"] Hosts to which all connections should bypass the proxy. Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation. This feature is the Gradle analogy for the analyze imports command in the CLI. It builds a graph of imports of the provided source modules. build.gradle build.gradle.kts pkl { analyzers { imports { appConfig { sourceModules.add(file(\"src/main/resources/appConfig.pkl\")) } } } } pkl { analyzers { imports { register(\"appConfig\") { sourceModules.add(file(\"src/main/resources/appConfig.pkl\")) } } } } outputFormat: Property Same meaning as outputFormat in Module Evaluation. outputFile: RegularFileProperty Same meaning as outputFile in Module Evaluation. Common properties: sourceModules: ListProperty Default: [] Example 1: sourceModules = [\"module1.pkl\", \"module2.pkl\"] Example 2: sourceModules = fileTree(\"config\").include(\"**/*.pkl\") List of Pkl modules which are used for this operation. This property accepts the following types to represent a module: java.net.URI java.io.File java.nio.file.Path java.net.URL java.lang.CharSequence - if the represented string looks like a URI (it contains a scheme), the input is treated as a URI. Otherwise, it is treated as a path. Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. org.gradle.api.file.FileSystemLocation transitiveModules: ConfigurableFileCollection Default: [computed by pkl-gradle] Example 1: transitiveModules.from files(\"module1.pkl\", \"module2.pkl\") Example 2: transitiveModules.from fileTree(\"config\").include(\"**/*.pkl\") File paths of modules that are directly or indirectly used by source modules. This property, along with sourceModules, is the set of input files used to determine whether this task is up-to-date or not. By default, Pkl computes this property by analyzing the imports of the source modules. Setting this property explicitly causes Pkl to skip the analyze imports step. Including source modules in transitiveModules is permitted but not required. Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. projectDir: DirectoryProperty Default: null Example 1: projectDir = layout.projectDirectory.dir(\"pkl\") Example 2: projectDir.fileValue file(\"/some/absolute/path\") Directory where the project lives. A project is a directory that contains a PklProject file, which is used to declare package dependencies, as well as common evaluator settings to be applied in the project. If null, this is determined by searching up from the working directory for a directory that contains a PklProject file, until evalRootDir or the file system root is reached. omitProjectSettings: Property Disables loading evaluator settings from the PklProject file. noProject: Property Disables all behavior related to projects. settingsModule: Property Default: null Example: settingsModule = layout.projectDirectory.file(\"mySettings.pkl\") The Pkl settings module to use. This property accepts the same input types as the sourceModules property. If null, ~/.pkl/settings.pkl or defaults specified in the pkl.settings standard library module are used. allowedModules: ListProperty Default: [\"pkl:\", \"file:\", \"modulepath:\", \"https:\", \"repl:\", \"package:\", \"projectpackage:\"] Example: allowedModules = [\"file:\"] URI patterns that determine which modules can be loaded and evaluated. Patterns are matched against the beginning of module URIs. (File paths have been converted to file: URLs at this stage.) At least one pattern needs to match for a module to be loadable. allowedResources: ListProperty Default: [\"env:\", \"prop:\", \"modulepath:\", \"https:\", \"file:\", \"package:\", \"projectpackage:\"] Example: allowedResources = [\"env:\", \"prop:\"] URL patterns that determine which external resources can be read. Patterns are matched against the beginning of resource URLs. At least one pattern needs to match for a resource to be readable. environmentVariables: MapProperty Default: [:] (note that Gradle default differs from CLI default) Example 1: environmentVariables = [\"MY_VAR_1\": \"myValue1\", \"MY_VAR_2\": \"myValue2\"] Example 2: environmentVariables = System.getenv() Environment variables that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"env:\"). evalRootDir: DirectoryProperty Default: rootProject.layout.projectDirectory Example 1: evalRootDir = layout.projectDirectory.dir(\"pkl-modules\") Example 2: evalRootDir.fileValue file(\"/some/absolute/path\") Root directory for file: modules and resources. If non-null, access to file-based modules and resources is restricted to those located under the root directory. Any symlinks are resolved before this check is performed. evalTimeout: Property Default: null Example: evalTimeout = Duration.ofSeconds(10) Duration after which evaluation of a source module will be timed out. Note that a timeout is treated the same as a program error in that any subsequent source modules will not be evaluated. externalProperties: MapProperty Default: [:] Example: externalProperties = [\"myProp1\": \"myValue1\", \"myProp2\": \"myValue2\"] External properties that can be read by Pkl code with read(\"prop:\"). moduleCacheDir: DirectoryProperty Default: null Example 1: moduleCacheDir = layout.buildDirectory.dir(\"pkl-module-cache\") Example 2: moduleCacheDir.fileValue file(\"/absolute/path/to/cache\") The cache directory for storing packages. If null, defaults to ~/.pkl/cache. color: Property Default: false Format messages using ANSI color. noCache: Property Default: false Disable caching of packages. modulePath: ConfigurableFileCollection Default: files() (empty collection) Example: modulePath.from files(\"dir1\", \"zip1.zip\", \"jar1.jar\") The directories, ZIP archives, or JAR archives to search when resolving modulepath: URIs. Relative paths are resolved against the project directory. proxy: Property Default: null Example: proxy = uri(\"http://proxy.example.com:1234\") Configures HTTP connections to connect to the provided proxy address. The URI must have scheme http, and may not contain anything other than a host and port. noProxy: ListProperty Default: null Example: noProxy = [\"example.com\", \"169.254.0.0/16\"] Hosts to which all connections should bypass the proxy. Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using CIDR notation.","title":"Gradle Plugin","component":"main","version":"0.27.1","name":"index","url":"/main/current/pkl-gradle/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"installation","id":1},{"text":"Module Evaluation","hash":"module-evaluation","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage","id":3},{"text":"Configuration Options","hash":"configuration-options","id":4},{"text":"Tests","hash":"tests","id":5},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage-2","id":6},{"text":"Java Code Generation","hash":"java-code-gen","id":7},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage-3","id":8},{"text":"Configuration Options","hash":"configuration-options-2","id":9},{"text":"Kotlin Code Generation","hash":"kotlin-code-gen","id":10},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage-4","id":11},{"text":"Configuration Options","hash":"configuration-options-3","id":12},{"text":"Pkldoc generation","hash":"pkldoc-generation","id":13},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage-5","id":14},{"text":"Configuration Options","hash":"configuration-options-4","id":15},{"text":"Project packaging","hash":"project-package","id":16},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage-6","id":17},{"text":"Configuration Options","hash":"configuration-options-5","id":18},{"text":"Project Resolving","hash":"project-resolving","id":19},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage-7","id":20},{"text":"Configuration Options","hash":"configuration-options-6","id":21},{"text":"Analyze Imports","hash":"analyze-imports","id":22},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage-8","id":23},{"text":"Configuration Options","hash":"configuration-options-7","id":24}]},"32":{"id":32,"text":"Pkl 0.25 was released on February 1st, 2024.

The next release (0.27) is scheduled for October 10th, 2024. Please send feedback and questions to GitHub Discussions, or submit an issue on Github. Pkl is hosted on GitHub. To get started, follow Installation. News you don’t want to miss. Pkl is now available on Windows! (#492) In addition to macOS and Linux, Pkl is now available for download on Windows operating systems. For installation instructions, consult Windows Executable in the CLI reference. On Windows, the in-language filepath separator is still /. This means that most existing Pkl code should still continue working as-is. A small portion of programs will need to be updated to handle Windows support correctly. One example is the various conversion scripts that read input files as CLI flags. For example, here is a snippet from module k8s.contrib.convert: convert.pkl#L100-L103 local inputUri = if (input.startsWith(Regex(#\"\\w+:\"#))) input // absolute URI else if (input.startsWith(\"/\")) \"file://\\(input)\" // absolute file path else \"file://\\(read(\"env:PWD\"))/\\(input)\" // relative file path On Windows, the env var PWD is a Windows-style path, like C:\\Foo\\Bar\\Baz. With the above logic, inputUri can expand to a value like \"file://C:\\Foo\\Bar\\Baz/input.yaml\". This would an invalid URI; the correct URI should be \"file:///C:/Foo/Bar/Baz/input.yaml\". Here is a possible fix for this code: import \"pkl:platform\" local inputUri = if (input.startsWith(Regex(#\"\\w+:/\"#))) input else if (input.startsWith(\"/\")) \"file://\\(input)\" else let (pwd = read(\"env:PWD\")) let ( path = if (platform.current.operatingSystem.name == \"Windows\") \"/\\(pwd)/\\(input)\".replaceAll(\"\\\\\", \"/\") else \"\\(pwd)/\\(input)\" ) \"file://\\(path)\" To learn more about this design, consult SPICE-0006. Pkl now supports proxying HTTP(S) requests (#506). For users of the CLI, Pkl will by default look for proxy settings configured within the OS when on macOS, Windows, and GNOME environments. This can be changed by adding settings in the following locations: Settings file PklProject file --http-proxy and --http-no-proxy CLI flags As part of this, some changes have been made to the standard library. For details, see Standard Library changes. Users of the Java/Kotlin bindings can specify proxy settings when building an HTTP client. HTTP proxy settings are also added as new fields in the message-passing-api. Authors of external Pkl clients are encouraged to support these new fields to provide proxy support in their libraries. For details, see Message passing API changes. To read more about the design of HTTP proxying, consult SPICE-0004, and also the documentation. Improvements have been made to project dependencies (#486). A project dependency is a way to manage package-based modules. It provides two uses: A package can be imported through dependency notation. Conflicting versions in the transitive dependency graph are resolved. Currently, dependencies can only be used with file-based modules. This can be limiting in some circumstances: JVM library users typically interact with Pkl by bundling Pkl files a classpath resources, and load them using modulepath: URIs. Go library users often embed Pkl code using the go:embed directive, and load them using WithFs. This means that these users miss out on the benefits of project dependencies. Pkl 0.26 adds support for using dependencies in any hierarchical module scheme. This means that modulepath: users in Java can now declare projects and dependencies. This also means that other custom methods of embedding modules can also use dependency notation. A hierarchical URI is a URI whose path part starts with /, and in which / delimits path segments. The URI myscheme:/foo.pkl is hierarchical, whereas the URI myscheme:foo.pkl is not. To read more about this design, consult SPICE-0005. Improvements have been made to `typealias`es (#144, #373, #516). Currently, a typealias that references a value on its enclosing module will break if used in another module. myModule.pkl typealias StartsWithFoo = String(startsWith(foo)) foo = \"foo\" import \"myModule.pkl\" myStr: StartsWithFoo = \"fooey\" This results in error: –– Pkl Error –– Cannot find property `foo`. 1 | typealias StartsWithFoo = String(startsWith(foo)) This is a language bug that has been fixed. In the process of fixing this bug, we realized that the rules around variable resolution within typealiases were problematic. Typealiases are meant to be statically defined, and shouldn’t be able to see properties that can be late-bound. Thus, a new rule is introduced: a typealias can only reference properties/methods that are const. This is a breaking change. To read more about this breakage and remediation steps, reference Typealiases are treated as const. Ready when you need them. The following improvements have been made to Pkldoc: The documentation for the standard library no longer shows dependent packages, because every package implicitly depends on the standard library (#503). If the standard library exists in the package list, it is shown first (#165). Fewer characters are percent-encoded. For example, the ( and ) characters are no longer percent-encoded (#489). To support http proxying, several changes have been made to the standard library (#506). Module pkl.settings has new property http. class EvaluatorSettings originally in pkl.Project has been moved to its own module. For backwards compatibility, pkl.Project now has a typealias EvaluatorSettings pointing to the new module, but it is marked @Deprecated. A new Java API is introduced, named org.pkl.core.http.HttpClient (#217, #295, #506, #518). This interface provides the ability to manage how Pkl makes HTTP(S) calls, including how it deals with CA certificates, as well as proxies. This client can be passed to Pkl’s evaluator using EvaluatorBuilder for users of pkl-core, and ConfigEvaluatorBuilder for users of pkl-config-java or pkl-config-kotlin. A new module key factory for HTTP(S) modules has been added (#495), and can be built with org.pkl.core.ModuleKeyFactories#http. The preconfigured evaluator (org.pkl.core.EvaluatorBuilder#preconfigured) includes this module key. Users that build their own evaluator from scratch should add this module key factory if HTTP(S) modules are needed. Example: import org.pkl.core.EvaluatorBuilder; import org.pkl.core.module.ModuleKeyFactories; var evaluator = EvaluatorBuilder.unconfigured() + .addModuleKeyFactory(ModuleKeyFactories.http) (1) .build(); 1 Add ModuleKeyFactories.http to the set of module key factories used by this evaluator. If this module key factory is not added, Pkl may still make HTTP(S) requests if ModuleKeyFactories.genericUrl is included. However, this bypasses proxy and CA certificate settings. A new set of parameters are now available to org.pkl.executor.Executor (#217, #518). These new parameters are exposed by org.pkl.executor.spi.v1.ExecutorSpiOptions2. The new parameters are: certificateFiles: A set of CA certificate files to trust when making HTTPS requests. certificateBytes: A set of PEM-encoded CA certificate bytes to trust when making HTTPS requests. testPort: An option that is used for internal testing only. These options are ignored when using a Pkl distribution whose version is lower than 0.26.0. A new property, http, is added to Create Evaluator Request (#506, #518). This allows for the configuration of Pkl’s HTTP proxy, as well as CA certificates. The Java and Kotlin code generators have a new option that allows users to change the name of Java/Kotlin classes that get produced during code generation (#499). The CLIs have a new flag, --rename, and the Gradle plugin receives a similarly named property called renames. This option accepts a map from an old prefix to a new prefix, where longer prefixes have higher precedence than shorter prefixes. For example, when generating module foo.Bar, specifying --rename foo.=com.foo. will cause the Java/Kotlin code generators to emit package com.foo, and class Bar. Things to watch out for when upgrading. A breaking change has been made to typealiases (#516). Typealiases are types that can stand in for another type declaration. The aliased type can have constraints, where these constraints can reference values defined on the enclosing module. baseModule.pkl typealias MyValue = Any(isValid) (1) isValid = true 1 isValid is defined on the enclosing module. One problem with this is that typealiases are meant to be statically defined. Like classes, typealiases should not be changed by amending its enclosing module. amends \"baseModule.pkl\" isValid = false (1) 1 Despite this amended value, typealias MyValue should still stand for Any(true). To have clearer semantics, a new rule is introduced: referenced members on the enclosing module must be const. Effectively, a typealias is treated as if it is also a const member. To fix the above typealias, the const modifier should be added to isValid. typealias MyValue = Any(isValid) -isValid = true +const isValid = true It might not always be valid to add the const modifier. For example, this property may be overwritten in a downstream module, so adding the const modifier this would break that module. In these cases, another fix is to self-import the enclosing module. This works because import declarations introduce values that are implicitly marked const. baseModule.pkl +import \"baseModule.pkl\" (1) + -typealias MyValue = Any(isValid) +typealias MyValue = Any(baseModule.isValid) isValid = true 1 Self import This change aligns with the behavior of class and annotation bodies. To read more about the rationale behind this change, consult SPICE-0007. The parsing of relative path imports has changed (#486). Currently, the declaration import \"@foo/bar.pkl\" is treated as the import of a dependency named foo, but only when declared within file-based and package-based modules. In an HTTP-based module, for example, the above import is treated as \"bar.pkl inside directory @foo\". To improve project dependencies, such declarations are treated as dependency notation in all modules, and will fail with error \"Cannot find dependency\". Any import/reads that are intentionally relative-path imports will need to be updated to be prefixed with ./. Example: -import \"@bar/foo.pkl\" +import \"./@bar/foo.pkl\" The minimum Java version for Pkl has been bumped to Java 17 (#439). This means that when running the jpkl CLI, the installed java is expected to be Java 17 or higher. This also means that users of the JVM libraries need to be on at least Java 17 or higher. The minimum Gradle version for the Gradle plugin is now 8.1 (#454). In order to support Windows, the output of some Pkl tools have unsafe characters encoded in a special format (#489). On Windows, the characters , :, \", \\, |, ?, and * are reserved and cannot exist in a filename. Additionally, the ASCII control character code points 0x0 through 0x1f are also illegal. These characters are encoded by wrapping their hexadecimal code point value in parentheses. For example, the character : is encoded as (3a). In some scenarios, files that get written to disk will be encoded. These are: Files generated by Pkldoc. *.kt files produced by the Kotlin code generator. Packages written to the cache directory. To learn more about this design, consult SPICE-0003. The links generated by Pkldoc have changed. For example, a module called module `foo/package-1 to /package-2. If Pkl’s dependencies are vendored within a repository, these dependencies will need to be re-vendored. The following Java APIs have breaking changes: Class/method Breaking change org.pkl.cli.commands.CliDownloadPackageCommand Renamed to org.pkl.cli.commands.CliPackageDownloader org.pkl.cli.commands.CliAbstractProjectCommand Renamed to org.pkl.cli.commands.CliProjectCommand org.pkl.config.java.InvalidMappingException Fields pklName and javaName are now private. org.pkl.core.packages.PackageResolver#getInstance New parameter httpClient added org.pkl.core.repl.ReplServer.ReplServer New parameter httpClient added org.pkl.commons.cli.CliBaseOptions New parameters testPort, httpProxy, httpNoProxy added Class pkl.Project.EvaluatorSettings has been removed. A new (deprecated) typealias is added that points to new module pkl.EvaluatorSettings. For both of these, see #506. The loading of the settings file has changed (#477). The settings file is a way to control the behavior of the Pkl CLI. This module is expected to amends \"pkl:settings\", but this behavior was not checked. In 0.26, it is an error if the settings module neither amends \"pkl:settings\", nor set its output.value to an instance of the settings module. Currently, the pkl project package command will bundle empty directories into the resulting ZIP file. In version 0.26, this has been changed to exclude these directories (#330). This means that the packages can produce a different checksum if there are any empty directories. This does not break the usage of existing packages, and does not affect compatibility of new packages used with older Pkl 0.25. However, this can break certain workflows. The pkl project package command runs a publish check, to determine if a package has already been published but with a different checksum. When upgrading, users might encounter an error message like the following: -- Pkl Error -- Package `package://example.com/foo@1.0.0` was already published with different contents. To mitigate, the package’s version needs to be bumped, even if package contents have not changed. The following changes have been made that are not new features, nor breaking changes. Pkl’s user-agent header for HTTP requests has been tweaked to add a semicolon (#221). Here is an example difference: Before: Pkl/0.26 (macOS native) After: Pkl/0.26 (macOS; native) Documentation improvements (#120, #121, #142, #121, #337, #341, #372, #386, #391, #397, #422, #436, #469, #484, #485, #491). Optimization: const access is checked when variables are resolved, instead of every time the variable is accessed (#438). Optimization: use logical AND instead of bitwise AND when comparing numbers (#102). Mark Java classes final (#458). Migrate code to newer JDK17 features, and clean up existing Java code (#451, #458, #512). Improve rendering of string values within generated .pkl-expected.pcf files when running pkl test (#416). Improve performance of loading Pkl’s built-in CA certificates (#518). The following bugs have been fixed. Collection#sortWith produces un-sorted output (#394). Property typedType in module pkl.reflect reflects upon Type, instead of Typed (#426). const members can be assigned to when via an object spread (#428). Relative globbed reads resolve to the same value in different modules (#449). Performance bug: globbed imports and globbed reads expand to an unbounded number of root nodes (#449). Relative globbed imports within a package match no modules (#496). Constraints within typealiases resolve to the wrong values (#144). Members of pkl.reflect cannot be rendered (#170, #470). Throws NullPointerException if \"List Resources Response\" or \"List Modules Response\" messages contain both null pathElements and error (#480). Classes of com.oracle.truffle are not shaded in pkl-config-java-all and pkl-tools (#238). Throws PklBugException when running publish check on an invalid URL (#441).

The latest bugfix release is 0.27.1. (All Versions) This release brings improvements in typechecking of Listing and Mapping, the ability to use readers from external processes, as well as a new import graph analyzer API. The next release (0.28) is scheduled for February 2025. Please send feedback and questions to GitHub Discussions, or submit an issue on Github. Pkl is hosted on GitHub. To get started, follow Installation. News you don’t want to miss. Typechecking of Listing and Mapping types has been improved (#628, #725, #740, #752, #778, #781). Today, the typecheck listing: Listing immediately evaluates all listing elements to check that they have type E. Likewise, the typecheck mapping: Mapping immediately evaluates all mapping values to check that they have type V. For example, the typecheck listing: Listing proceeds as follows: Check that listing has type Listing Evaluate each listing element and check that it has type Bird This behavior is different from how the rest of Pkl works. Generally, Pkl only evaluates code that affects program output. For example, consider the following program: class Bird { name: String canFly: Boolean } local bird: Bird = new { name = \"Pidgy\" canFly = throw(\"uh oh\") } birdName = bird.name Even though bird.canFly throws an error, the above program succeeds because bird.canFly is not part of the program’s output and hence is never accessed (Note that bird is a local property). Typechecks of Mapping and Listing types have been changed to match this behavior. Mapping and listing values are now only typechecked if and when they are accessed. Mapping keys are still eagerly checked. This change causes some previously failing programs to evaluate successfully: local myNumbers: Listing = new { 1; 2; \"uh oh\" } result = myNumbers[0] In Pkl 0.26 and below, the above program fails with a type mismatch error because element \"uh oh\" is typechecked when myNumbers is accessed. In Pkl 0.27, the same program succeeds, because only element myNumbers[0] is part of the program’s output and its typecheck succeeds. As another consequence of this change, some Pkl programs now complete more quickly: local allBirds: Mapping = import*(\"**/bird.pkl\") environment: \"prod\"|\"qa\" cluster: String myBird = allBirds[\"\\(environment)/\\(cluster)/bird.pkl\"] (1) In Pkl 0.26 and below, all modules matching **/bird.pkl are imported when allBirds is accessed and typechecked. This can take a long time. In Pkl 0.27, only module \"\\(environment)/\\(cluster)/bird.pkl\" is imported because only this module is part of the program’s output. To learn more about this change, consult SPICE-0010. A new feature has been added to allow Pkl to spawn external processes to read resources and modules (#660, #762, #766, #770). Today, users who use Pkl as a library can define custom module and resource readers. This allows authors to extend how Pkl performs I/O. For example, users can implement a reader that reads the secret: scheme, where they define exactly how the bytes are fetched in the host runtime. result = read(\"secret:mypassword\") (1) 1 secret: is a custom scheme defined by the host runtime. However, CLI users have been left out. In Pkl 0.27, a new extension point is added to allow users to implement module and resource readers as external processes. When run, Pkl will spawn the external process, and talk to the process via message passing. To learn more about this feature, consult SPICE-0009. Thanks to @HT154 for contributing the feature! A new API has been added to analyze the import graph of Pkl modules (#695). This API comes in four forms: A standard library module: pkl:analyze A CLI command: pkl anaylze imports A Java API: org.pkl.core.Analyzer A Gradle API: org.pkl.gradle.task.AnalyzeImportsTask Some use-cases for this API are: For build tools to perform out-of-date checks. Build tools can invalidate a cached result if any of the transitive modules have changed. Static code analysis, to determine how Pkl modules depend on each other. With this API, Gradle Plugin now by default computes the transitive modules for many of its tasks. Here is an example of the CLI in use: pkl analyze imports -f json myModule.pkl (1) 1 -f means: produce output in JSON. Produces: { \"imports\": { \"file:///my/proj/myModule.pkl\": [ { \"uri\": \"projectpackage://example.com/birds@1.0.0#/Bird.pkl\" } ], \"projectpackage://example.com/birds@1.0.0#/Bird.pkl\": [] }, \"resolvedImports\": { \"file:///my/proj/myModule.pkl\": \"file:///my/proj/myModule.pkl\", \"projectpackage://example.com/birds@1.0.0#/Bird.pkl\": \"file:///my/birds/Bird.pkl\" } } From this output, we can see that myModule.pkl imports Bird.pkl from the birds package. We can also see that the module projectpackage://example.com/birds@1.0.0#/Bird.pkl resolves to disk location file:///my/birds/Bird.pkl (we can deduce that birds is a local dependency). To learn more about this feature, consult SPICE-0001. Ready when you need them. The Pkl CLI will now emit some messages in color (#552, #746, #771, #779). Here is a sneak peek of colored error messages in action. Thanks to @thomaspurchas for contributing to this feature! The const modifier can be applied to object members, provided that they are also local (#678). Currently, regular object members are not allowed to have the const modifier. This introduces an artificial pain point. For example, given the following module: amends \"Bird.pkl\" import \"Bird.pkl\" local northAmerica = \"North America\" local typealias NorthAmericanBird = Bird(this.origin == northAmerica) (1) 1 Error: cannot reference northAmerica from here because it is not const. This is invalid code, because this typealias is referencing a non-const value on the enclosing module. However, is not possible fix this by adding the const modifier to northAmerica. This is because this module amends \"Bird.pkl\", which means that this module is considered a regular object and not a class. This means that any members declared here are object members, and not class members. In Pkl 0.27, a new rule is introduced to allow the const modifier to be applied to object members, provided that they are also local. This change affects object properties, as well as object methods. To read more about this design, consult SPICE-0011. Some new common flags have been added to the CLI (#660, #746). Flag Description --color Format messages with ANSI color codes --external-module-reader Shell out to a process to read certain modules. --external-resource-reader Shell out to a process to read certain resources. As part of the set of APIs added for import analysis, a new subcommand has been added called analyze imports (#695). For details, consult the CLI documentation. Various improvements have been made to the Kotlin and Java code generators (#705, #710, #714, #721, #729). Only generate hashCode(), equals(), and toString() methods for Java classes that are instantiable. Add support for Spring Boot 3. Make module classes also implement serializable. Make empty Java classes instantiable. Skip generation of copy(), equals(), hashCode(), toString() methods for abstract Kotlin classes. Don’t implement Serializable for abstract classes Add support for Spring Boot 3. Thanks to @translatenix for contributing these improvements! A new task called org.pkl.gradle.task.AnalyzeImportsTask is introduced (#695). This task is the Gradle analogy to pkl analyze imports. Example: build.gradle build.gradle.kts pkl { analyzers { imports { appConfig { sourceModules.add(file(\"src/main/resources/appConfig.pkl\")) } } } } pkl { analyzers { imports { register(\"appConfig\") { sourceModules.add(file(\"src/main/resources/appConfig.pkl\")) } } } } For more details, consult the documentation. Tasks created by the Pkl plugin now declare tracked output files (#403). This means that downstream tasks do not need to declare an explicit dependency on the Pkl task. For example, assuming that evalPkl is an EvalTask: build.gradle.kts val myGradleTask by tasks.registering { inputs.files(evalPkl) - dependsOn(evalPkl) (1) } 1 No longer necessary to declare this dependency. The transitiveModules property of a task is now computed by building the import graph of the source modules (#695). This means that Pkl-related tasks no longer need to declare their set of transitive modules, because the pkl-gradle plugin will compute this automatically. This adds latency to each task. To opt out of this behavior, set transitiveModules explicitly. New properties and methods have been added to the classes of pkl:base (#666, #683). New properties and methods have been added to Listing and Mapping. One of the goals of this change is to improve the experience of authoring constraints. This eliminates the need to convert to collection types as often. The added properties and methods are: Listing.first Listing.firstOrNull Listing.last Listing.lastOrNull Listing.single Listing.singleOrNull Listing.every() Listing.any() Listing.contains() Mapping.containsValue() Mapping.every() Mapping.any() With this, the following change can be made to existing constraints: -ipAddresses: Listing(toList().contains(\"127.0.0.1\")) +ipAddresses: Listing(contains(\"127.0.0.1\")) Additionally, a new method is added to String, called String.splitLimit(). New properties have been added to pkl:EvaluatorSettings (#660, #746). These are: color externalModuleReaders externalResourceReaders The String to Number converter methods, for example, String.toInt(), can now handle underscore separators (#578, #580). This better aligns with the source code representation of number literals. myNum = \"1_000\".toInt() (1) 1 Result: 1000 As part of Import analysis API, a new standard library module is added called pkl:analyze (#695). This module provides an API for computing the total import graph given a set of input modules. This API treats the inputs as entrypoints, and produces a graph representing the entire dependency tree, including transitive imports. Example: import \"pkl:analyze\" importGraph: analyze.ImportGraph = analyze.importGraph(Set(\"file:///path/to/my/module.pkl\")) For details, see the documentation. When creating packages, some annotations on a PklProject will affect how pkldoc generates documentation. @Unlisted: Omit the package from publishing documentation. @Deprecated: Add information on the package to show that it is deprecated. Example: PklProject @Deprecated amends \"pkl:Project\" The report generated from pkl test has been overhauled and improved (#498, #682, #738, #771). Tests are grouped into either the facts or examples section. A summary line is added, describing how many tests have passed and failed, and how many assertions have passed and failed. Test results are colored. The ✅ and ❌ emojis are replaced with ✔ and ✘. Thrown errors are reported within the test. Here is a sneak peek of the new test result output. Thanks to @jjmaestro for contributing to this improvement! As part of Import analysis API, a new Java API called org.pkl.core.Analyzer is introduced (#695). The following methods are added: pkl-executor org.pkl.executor.ExecutorException.getPklVersion org.pkl.executor.ExecutorException.ExecutorException(java.lang.String, java.lang.Throwable, java.lang.String) pkl-core org.pkl.core.module.ModuleKeyFactories.externalProcess(java.lang.String, org.pkl.core.externalreader.ExternalReaderProcess) org.pkl.core.module.ModuleKeyFactories.externalProcess(java.lang.String, org.pkl.core.externalreader.ExternalReaderProcess, long) Things to watch out for when upgrading. The following Java APIs have breaking changes: Class/method Breaking change org.pkl.core.runtime.TestResults Moved to org.pkl.core.TestResults, turned into a record, and largely restructured. org.pkl.core.module.ModuleKeyFactories.closeQuietly Deprecated for removal in favor of org.pkl.core.Closeables.closeQuietly. The Java code generator no longer supports Spring Boot 2.x (#729). Spring Boot 2 users can continue to use the Pkl 0.26 code generator. If running pkl test results in pkl-expected.pcf files being written, the test now exits with exit code 10 (#738). Additionally, the junit reports will consider the test as failing. Due to changes to Listing and Mapping typechecking, some previously failing programs now succeed. This can happen when erroneous code is never evaluated because it does not affect program output: local myNumbers: Listing = new { 1; 2; \"uh oh\" } result = myNumbers[0] (1) 1 In Pkl 0.26 and below, throws a type mismatch error. In Pkl 0.27, yields 1. Make pkl-doc top box include a preview of the rest of module-level documentation (#570). Module pkl-core now has a dependency on org.msgpack:msgpack-core (#660). Users concerned about potential version conflicts can use one of Pkl’s shaded fat JARs (pkl-config-java-all, pkl-tools). Make PklProject.deps.json files end in a newline (#644). Fix invalid syntax of code examples in stdlib doc comments (#703). Update Java dependencies (#689, #767). Add jbang catalog support (#655). Documentation improvements (#623, #680, #682, #685, #687, #703, #704, #715, #730, #753). The following bugs have been fixed. CLI --property flags containing = in property values are not parsed correctly (#630). Thrown PklBugException when reading assets from a local project dependency (#641). Thrown PklBugException when PklProjects have a cyclical local dependency (#731). Thrown exception when sending ReadResourceResponse or ReadModuleResponse where both contents and error are null (#657). Double unary minus is evaluated as single unary minus (#697). Kotlin compiler fails to compiler generated classes with \"copy overrides nothing\" for subclasses of abstract classes (#569). \"Unexpected error\" thrown when Module.output has its type overridden (#709). \"Unexpected error\" thrown when loading files with non-ASCII characters (#653). Type parameters in new Mapping/new Listing are not checked (#405). Comparison methods of pkl:semver are incorrect (#772).

Fixes a possible race condition where multiple concurrent Pkl evaluations results in a thrown exception when downloading packages (#584). Fixes a regression where native executables fail to run on some environments that don’t support newer CPU features (#551). Fixes a PklBugException when passing . as a project directory to pkl project resolve and pkl project package (#544). Disable revocation checking of TLS certificates (#553). As part of HTTP improvements in 0.26, we unwittingly fixed a bug where Pkl does not actually perform cert revocation checks when making HTTPS requests. This fix, unfortunately, caused a regression in some cases. For example, this happens when connecting to a server that bears a public trust certificate, while in an environment with no internet access. This is because the HTTP client needs to check the revocation status of all certificates in the chain. Revocation checks are a nuanced topic with some benefits, and also with its own problem areas. For this reason, revocation checking is disabled for Pkl’s native CLIs. Users of Pkl’s Java APIs will respect the revocation settings set in the JVM.

The source code for this example is available on GitHub. The equivalent Kotlin example is here. For background information, see Externalized Configuration, in particular Type-safe Configuration Properties, in the Spring Boot documentation. Define a configuration schema in src/main/resources: AppConfig.pkl // this module name determines the package and // class name of the generated Java config class module samples.boot.AppConfig server: Server class Server { endpoints: Listing } class Endpoint { name: String port: UInt16 } Define an Application Property File next to the schema: application.pkl amends \"modulepath:/appConfig.pkl\" server { endpoints { new { name = \"endpoint1\" port = 1234 } new { name = \"endpoint2\" port = 5678 } } } Use Pkl’s Gradle plugin to generate Java config classes from the schema. Generated classes are placed in generated/configClasses/ and compiled together with your production code. To run the generator directly (which isn’t typically necessary), type ./gradlew configClasses. Groovy Kotlin build.gradle plugins { id \"org.pkl-lang\" version \"$pklVersion\" } pkl { javaCodeGenerators { configClasses { generateGetters.set(true) generateSpringBootConfig.set(true) sourceModules.set(files(\"src/main/resources/AppConfig.pkl\")) } } } settings.gradle pluginManagement { repositories { mavenCentral() } } build.gradle.kts plugins { id(\"org.pkl-lang\") version \"$pklVersion\" } pkl { javaCodeGenerators { register(\"configClasses\") { generateGetters.set(true) generateSpringBootConfig.set(true) sourceModules.set(files(\"src/main/resources/AppConfig.pkl\")) } } } settings.gradle.kts pluginManagement { repositories { mavenCentral() } } Annotate your Boot application class with @ConfigurationPropertiesScan. (Alternatively, explicitly list configuration classes with @EnableConfigurationProperties(…​).) @SpringBootApplication @ConfigurationPropertiesScan public class Application { ... } Inject the generated config classes into your application’s components as appropriate. @Service public class Server { public Server(AppConfig.Server config) { ... } } To get access to the entire configuration, inject the AppConfig class itself: @Service public class Server { public Server(AppConfig config) { ... } } This example demonstrates one way of configuring Spring Boot applications with Pkl. Some possible deviations are: Use multiple config files, for example one per environment. Read config files from the file system instead of the class path. Write config classes by hand instead of generating them. Do not define a config schema. (Config classes cannot be generated in this case.) Use a build tool other than Gradle. Declare a build dependency on pkl-codegen-java. Invoke the code generator’s main method during the build, passing the required arguments. Configure the build to compile generated config classes together with your production code.

Code generation is done through the pkl-gen-go binary. To install: go install github.com/apple/pkl-go/cmd/pkl-gen-go@v0.9.0 Once installed, Go may be generated from Pkl: pkl-gen-go config/AppConfig.pkl Options may be provided to the code generator either using CLI flags, or using a settings file. The settings file is a Pkl file that amends module package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-go/pkl.golang@0.9.0#/GeneratorSettings.pkl. By default, the code generator will look for a generator-settings.pkl file residing in the current working directory. If found, it is used to configure the code generator. The settings file may also be set using the --generator-settings flag. The base path setting determines the relative path in which files get written to the working directory. It also acts as a filter to skip codegen for any modules that are external to the project. For example, if a Pkl module corresponds to Go package github.com/myorg/myproject/appconfig, and the base path is github.com/myorg/myproject, the generated files are placed into output directory appconfig/. If a base path is not explicitly set, pkl-gen-go will also look for a go.mod file in the current working directory and use the Go module name as the base path. If the base path cannot be determined, the full package path is written to the current working directory. The base path may be set in the settings file, and also via the --base-path CLI flag. If the determined package name is not prefixed by the base path, it is skipped from code generation. During codegen, the generator requires a mapping from a Pkl module name to a Go package name. In normal cases, this should be provided using the @go.Package annotation. However, there are times when this is infeasible, for example, if the Pkl module is external to the project. For these situations, mappings can be provided using the packageMappings property in the settings file, or using the --mapping CLI flag. By default, all struct fields receive a pkl tag. Additional tags can be configured either on a per-property basis, or globally for all properties. To configure tags on a per-property basis, use the @go.Field annotation on a property. To configure tags globally for all properties, use the structTags property the generator settings file. Here is an example for setting struct tags for a single property: @go.Field { structTags { [\"toml\"] = \"%{name},omitempty\" (1) } } firstName: String 1 Add toml:\"firstName,omitempty\" as a struct tag To share struct tag settings across multiple properties, define a child class of go.Field. class TomlField extends go.Field { structTags { [\"toml\"] = \"%{name},omitempty\" } } @TomlField firstName: String @TomlField lastName: String The below table describes how Pkl types are mapped into Go types. Pkl type Go type Null nil Boolean bool String string Int int Int8 int8 Int16 int16 Int32 int32 UInt uint UInt8 uint8 UInt16 uint16 UInt32 uint32 Float float64 Number float64 List []T Listing []T Map map[K]V Mapping map[K]V Set map[T]struct{} Pair *pkl.Pair[A, B] Dynamic *pkl.Object DataSize *pkl.DataSize Duration *pkl.Duration IntSeq *pkl.IntSeq Class [1]. *pkl.Class TypeAlias [1]. *pkl.TypeAlias Any any unknown any Unions (A|B|C) any [2] pkl.Class, pkl.TypeAlias, pkl.IntSeq and pkl.Pair only exist for compatibilty purposes because they are possible Pkl runtime values. Classes turn into a variation of structs and interfaces, depending on inheritance. Interfaces get generated because Go cannot model polymorphism with structs alone (e.g. a value that is a Dog struct is not assignable when an Animal struct is expected). When generating interfaces, a getter is generated for every property by prefixing Get to the property name. The below table describes how classes get generated. Pkl class Go interface Go struct class Person type Person struct open class Person type Person interface type PersonImpl struct abstract class Person type Person interface class Person extends Being type Person interface [3] type PersonImpl struct [4] In the case of inheritance, the parent’s struct and interface are embedded. If a typealias is defined as a union of string literals, it is turned into a new type backed by string. Each member of the union is generated as its own constant. The new type is placed into a subpackage of the module’s mapped Go package. For example, the following Pkl code: typealias City = \"San Francisco\"|\"Cupertino\"|\"London\" Turns into something like this: package city type City string const ( SanFrancisco City = \"San Francisco\" Cupertino City = \"Cupertino\" London City = \"London\" ) If the names of the determined constants conflicts due to normalization rules, an enum is not generated, and a string type is instead inlined into the usage locations. If a typealias isn’t a union of string literals, its resolved type is inlined into the usage locations. The Pkl type nothing is ignored when a member of a union. Therefore, typealias City = nothing|\"San Francisco\"|\"Cupertino\"|\"London\" is still considered an enum. When turning Pkl names into Go names, the code generator follows these rules: Any non-letter and non-digit characters get stripped, and each proceding letter gets capitalized. If a name does not start with a latin alphabet character, prefix with N. Capitalize so they get exported. As a result, it is possible that two names collide and turn into the same Go name. To resolve these conflicts, the @go.Name annotation must be used on at least one of these declaractions so the resulting names are distinct. For example: @go.Name { value = \"MyCoolApplication\" } class My_Application class MyApplication 1. The runtime value, not an instance 2.

Much like implementing Custom Readers, external readers are implemented by providing one or more instances of the pkl.ResourceReader and pkl.ModuleReader interfaces.

It can be configured with custom readers, have its own security settings, control external property inputs, and more. Evaluation occurs by spawning the pkl cli as a child process, and communicates via message passing. There are two methods for initializing a pkl.Evaluator: pkl.NewEvaluator pkl.EvaluatorManager.NewEvaluator These two constructors are distinguished by how they manage the lifecycle of the underlying pkl child process. pkl.NewEvaluator will spawn a child process per-evaluator, whereas pkl.EvaluatorManager.NewEvalutor will spawn a child process for the lifetime of the evaluator manager. For most use-cases, it is sufficient to use the pkl.NewEvaluator constructor. If multiple evaluators are desired, for example, to maintain separate caches or to have different settings, the evaluator manager should be used. Go packages generated from Pkl modules may be evaluated simply through the generated LoadFromPath and Load methods. For example, a generated package github.com/myapp/myteam/appconfig can be used for evaluation like so: package main import ( \"context\" \"fmt\" \"github.com/apple/pkl-go/pkl\" \"github.com/myapp/myteam/appconfig\" (1) ) func main() { cfg, err := appconfig.LoadFromPath(context.Background(), \"myconfig.pkl\") if err != nil { panic(err) } fmt.Printf(\"Got config: %+v\\n\", cfg) } 1 The generated package Pkl modules may be evaluated directly into Go structs without using code generation. For example, given the Pkl module: foo.pkl foo: String = \"hello\" bar: Int = 5 This may be evaluated into a Go struct via pkl.Evaluator.EvaluateModule. To run evaluation, pass a struct pointer that matches the structure of the module. If the Go property name doesn’t match the Pkl name, the pkl struct tag should be used to identify the Pkl property name. Example Go: package main import ( \"context\" \"fmt\" \"github.com/apple/pkl-go/pkl\" ) type MyConfig struct { Foo string `pkl:\"foo\"` Bar int `pkl:\"bar\"` } func main() { evaluator, err := pkl.NewEvaluator(context.Background(), pkl.PreconfiguredOptions) if err != nil { panic(err) } defer evaluator.Close() var cfg MyConfig if err = evaluator.EvaluateModule(context.Background(), pkl.FileSource(\"foo.pkl\"), &cfg); err != nil { panic(err) } fmt.Printf(\"Got module: %+v\", cfg) } In addition to modules, an evaluator may also evaluate a module’s output.text and output.files properties. This mimick the behavior of the CLI. Take this Pkl module: foo.pkl foo = \"foo\" bar = \"bar\" The textual output of this module may be evaluated via Evaluator.EvaluateOutputText. main.go package main import ( \"context\" \"fmt\" \"github.com/apple/pkl-go/pkl\" ) func main() { evaluator, err := pkl.NewEvaluator(context.Background(), pkl.PreconfiguredOptions) if err != nil { panic(err) } defer evaluator.Close() textOutput, err := evaluator.EvaluateOutputText(context.Background(), pkl.FileSource(\"foo.pkl\")) fmt.Println(textOutput) } In addition to evaluating modules and textual/file output, any arbitrary expression may be evaluated within a module. In fact, the textual and file output of a module are implemented in terms of evaluating an expression. main.go package main import ( \"context\" \"fmt\" \"github.com/apple/pkl-go/pkl\" ) func main() { evaluator, err := pkl.NewEvaluator(context.Background(), pkl.PreconfiguredOptions) if err != nil { panic(err) } defer evaluator.Close() var res string err = evaluator.EvaluateExpression( context.Background(), pkl.TextSource(\"foo = 5\"), (1) `\"foo is \\(foo)\"`, (2) &res, ) if err != nil { panic(err) } fmt.Println(res) // prints \"foo is 5\" } 1 TextSource causes Pkl to evaluate foo = 5 as a module 2 The expression to be evaluated pkl-go provides pkl.PreconfiguredOptions, which serves as a simple way to construct an evaluator with sensible defaults. Additional options may be provided via the functional options pattern: pkl.NewEvaluator(context.Background(), pkl.PreconfiguredOptions, func(opts *EvaluatorOptions) { opts.Logger = pkl.StderrLogger (1) }) 1 Log warn/trace messages to stderr It is possible to use a custom reader for resources and modules by implementing the pkl.ResourceReader and pkl.ModuleReader interfaces. Custom readers must identify the scheme that they are responsible for reading via the Scheme() method. For example, a reader may be registered to resolve the Pkl expression read(\"secret:FOO\") by registering \"secret\" as its scheme. If a resource matches a scheme identified by a custom reader, its Read() method will be called to retrieve the contents.","title":"Evaluator API","component":"go","version":"0.9.0","name":"evaluation","url":"/go/current/evaluation.html","titles":[{"text":"Initializing an evaluator","hash":"initializing-an-evaluator","id":1},{"text":"Evaluating modules","hash":"evaluating-modules","id":2},{"text":"With code generation","hash":"with-code-generation","id":3},{"text":"Without code generation","hash":"without-code-generation","id":4},{"text":"Alternative evaluation modes","hash":"alternative-evaluation-modes","id":5},{"text":"Textual and multiple file output","hash":"textual-and-multiple-file-output","id":6},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"expressions","id":7},{"text":"Evaluator options","hash":"evaluator-options","id":8},{"text":"Custom readers","hash":"custom-readers","id":9}]},"70":{"id":70,"text":"Pkl provides a rich integration with Go.

Create a new Pkl file in the directory of your choice, and annotate it with the @go.Package annotation. The name property in the annotation is the Go import path for the generated configuration file. In this example, the file is placed into pkl/AppConfig.pkl, and the Go package name for this Pkl module is github.com/myorg/myteam/appconfig. pkl/AppConfig.pkl @go.Package { name = \"github.com/myorg/myteam/appconfig\" } module myorg.myteam.AppConfig import \"package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-go/pkl.golang@0.9.0#/go.pkl\" (1) /// The hostname of this application. host: String /// The port to listen on. port: UInt16 1 Used for the @go.Package annotation.

Add the pkl-swift library as a dependency to your project’s Package.swift: Package.swift let package = Package( dependencies: [ .package(url: \"https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift\", from: \"0.2.1\") ], targets: [ .executableTarget( name: \"my-application\", dependencies: [.product(name: \"PklSwift\", package: \"pkl-swift\")] ), ] ) Also, ensure that Pkl is installed on your machine. Create a new Pkl file in the directory of your choice, to describe the schema of your configuration. In this example, the file is placed into pkl/AppConfig.pkl. pkl/AppConfig.pkl module AppConfig /// The hostname of this application. host: String /// The port to listen on. port: UInt16 With a schema defined, generate Swift source code for it. Code generation is done via the pkl-gen-swift CLI. To install, download it from Artifactory.

For more details on how to control code generation, consult pkl-gen-swift --help. With the above scaffolding set up, evaluate Pkl configuration data in Swift. First, define some configuration that uses the Pkl schema. In our example, we create a file at path pkl/local/appConfig.pkl. We imagine that we are defining configuration for a server running in a local environment, and would likewise place other environments in sibling directorys; e.g. pkl/int/appConfig.pkl and pkl/prod/appConfig.pkl. pkl/local/appConfig.pkl amends \"../AppConfig.pkl\" host = \"localhost\" port = 5939 Once defined, evaluate the Pkl module into Swift data.

The documentation below is intended for plugin implementors. pkl-lsp is published to Maven Central, and also as releases on GitHub. It is recommended that the jar file be bundled into an editor plugin’s package contents. To run the LSP, provide the jar as an argument to Java. For example: java -jar path/to/pkl-lsp.jar pkl-lsp requires Java 22 or higher. We plan on providing native binaries in the future. The LSP uses the pkl-lsp scheme to represent sources from the standard library, as well as other types of non-file Pkl sources. For example, the pkl:base standard library module is surfaced to editors as URI pkl-lsp://stdlib/base.pkl. When starting the LSP, additional client options can be provided to configure the behavior of the language server. These options are provided in the initializationOptions section of the Initialize Request. Type: Boolean Cause the LSP to render links within documentation using the command:pkl.open.file URI. If enabled, clients are expected to implement the command pkl.open.file. Tell the LSP that the client supports additional capabilities made available by pkl-lsp. Name Description actionableRuntimeNotifications The client supports the pkl/actionableNotification message. pklConfigureCommand The client supports the pkl.configure command. To support flows like sync projects, and package downloading, the LSP will look for a path to the Pkl CLI. By default, the LSP will look for the CLI within the enviornment’s $PATH. If the client supports the Configuration Request, it will look for the configuration value pkl.cli.path at scope Pkl. pkl-lsp extends the LSP protocol with custom message types.

Many languages also offer named parameters, which aid in API self-documentation. Pkl methods do not provide either feature, but one way to achieve similar results is the \"class-as-a-function\" (CaaF) pattern. In the class-as-a-function pattern, a class is created that accepts \"input\" properties and has one or more fixed \"output\" properties. Input properties are normal class properties. They are named, may have a type annotation, and may be defined with default values. Default values can be static values or may be derived from other properties. Output properties derive their value from the input properties. They are typically marked as fixed so they may not be overridden when amending instances of the class. class GreetingFunction { /// The name that should be greeted. name: String (1) /// The phrase used to greet [name]. greeting: String = \"Hello\" (2) /// The derived greeting. fixed message: String = \"\\(greeting), \\(name)!\" (3) } greetPigeon: String = new GreetingFunction { name = \"Pigeon\" }.message (4) greetHawk: String = new GreetingFunction { name = \"Hawk\"; greeting = \"Good day\" }.message (5) 1 A required input property. 2 An optional input property with a default value. 3 An output property, calculated from the input properties. 4 result: \"Hello, Pigeon!\" 5 result: \"Good day, Hawk!\" Despite the name, the pattern can also be applied using a module. The CaaF pattern is especially compelling in cases where multiple outputs will be derived from the same set of inputs. Instead of defining multiple methods that accept the same parameters, a single class may be defined with multiple output properties. In some cases, it may make sense to use CaaF in conjunction with output converters. This allows the \"un-called\" function instance to be used in place of the result data and enables amending the arguments to the function while still producing the desired output type and value, eg.: greetPigeon: GreetingFunction|String = \"こんばんは、鳩さん\" (1) greetHawk: GreetingFunction|String = new GreetingFunction { name = \"Hawk\" } (2) farewellHawk = (greetHawk) { greeting = \"Bye\" (3) } output { renderer { converters { [GreetingFunction] = (it) -> it.message (4) } } } 1 A fully custom greeting not using GreetingFunction. 2 result: \"Hi, Hawk!\" 3 result: \"Bye, Hawk!\" 4 Configuring a converter for GreetingFunction causes instances to be \"evaluated\" in the rendered output. Pkl’s system of property default values and late binding enables using class-as-a-function to concisely express inverse and even circular relationships between properties. This allows the same property to be both input and output, depending on how the function type is used. Using this technique entails declaring properties with default values derived from the other properties of the type in a cyclic fashion. Ordinarily, a circular data reference of this kind would result in a stack overflow error, but instantiating the type with the appropriate input(s) overridden with concrete values breaks the circular reference. class Temperature { fahrenheit: Float = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32 celsius: Float = kelvin - 273.15 kelvin: Float = (fahrenheit - 32) / 9 * 5 + 273.15 } fToK = new Temperature { fahrenheit = 72.0 }.kelvin fToC = new Temperature { fahrenheit = 72.0 }.celsius kToF = new Temperature { kelvin = 300.0 }.fahrenheit kToC = new Temperature { kelvin = 300.0 }.celsius cToF = new Temperature { celsius = 20.0 }.fahrenheit cToK = new Temperature { celsius = 20.0 }.kelvin The class-as-a-function pattern can be used to build abstraction layers that provide simple APIs resulting in more complex configurations. This is sometimes called \"embedding\" a class. Kubernetes is an example of a system that requires a lot of configuration to use. Often, deploying applications in Kubernetes requires repeating very similar configurations with only names and a few values changed. Here is an example of a CaaF module that uses class embedding to build a simple but extensible abstraction for basic web services: module SimpleApplication import \"package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-k8s/k8s@1.1.0#/K8sResource.pkl\" import \"package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-k8s/k8s@1.1.0#/api/apps/v1/Deployment.pkl\" import \"package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-k8s/k8s@1.1.0#/api/core/v1/Service.pkl\" import \"package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-k8s/k8s@1.1.0#/api/networking/v1/Ingress.pkl\" // input properties: /// Web application name name: String /// Container image tag image: String /// Application Pod replica count replicas: Int32? = 1 /// HTTP listen port port: UInt16 = 8080 /// URL Path to use for liveness checking livenessPath: String? = \"/livez\" /// URL Path to use for readiness checking readinessPath: String? = \"/readyz\" // output properties: local app = this (1) /// Kubernetes labels used for all output resources and selectors labels: Mapping = new { (2) [\"app.kubernetes.io/name\"] = name } /// Kuberetes [Deployment] that manages the application Pods. deployment: Deployment = new { (3) metadata { name = app.name labels = app.labels } spec { replicas = app.replicas template { metadata { labels = app.labels } spec { containers { new { name = app.name image = app.image when (livenessPath != null) { livenessProbe { httpGet { port = app.port path = livenessPath } } } when (readinessPath != null) { readinessProbe { httpGet { port = app.port path = readinessPath } } } } } } } } } /// Kubernetes [Service] that provides a cluster-internal VIP for the application. service: Service = new { (3) metadata { name = app.name labels = app.labels } spec { selector = app.labels ports { new { name = \"http\" port = app.port } } } } /// Kubernetes [Ingress] that exposes a VIP for the application outside the cluster. ingress: Ingress = new { (3) metadata { name = app.name labels = app.labels } spec { defaultBackend { service { name = app.service?.metadata?.name!! port { number = app.service.spec?.ports!![0].port } } } } } /// All Kubernetes resources needed to deploy the application. resources: Listing = new { (4) deployment service ingress } 1 This \"captures\" the SimpleApplication instance so its properties can be unambiguously referred to. 2 The labels property is an \"intermediary\" property that serves as a customization point, it is calculated from inputs by default but is not itself an output. 3 The deployment, service, and ingress properties are the module’s primary output properties. 4 For convenience, the resources property combines all of the above outputs into a single Listing. Notably, this example does not mark its output properties as fixed, which enables easy customization of these properties beyond what the module configures by default. Here are a few examples of using the SimpleApplication module: import \"SimpleApplication.pkl\" import \"package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-k8s/k8s@1.1.0#/K8sResource.pkl\" import \"package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-k8s/k8s@1.1.0#/api/networking/v1/NetworkPolicy.pkl\" /// The most basic [SimpleApplication] usage. /// /// The application image is expected to listen on port 8080 and provide `/livez` and `/readyz` paths app1: Listing = new SimpleApplication { name = \"app1\" image = \"myregistry/app1:latest\" }.resources /// Usage of [SimpleApplication] with additional input properties overridden. app2: Listing = new SimpleApplication { name = \"app2\" image = \"myregistry/app2:latest\" replicas = 3 port = 9090 livenessPath = null readinessPath = \"/healthz\" }.resources /// Advanced [SimpleApplication] usage where output properties are amended. /// /// This example amends [deployment] directly to set properties not exposed by [SimpleApplication]'s simple API. /// It also amends [resources] to add an additional resource required specifically by this application. app3: Listing = new SimpleApplication { name = \"app3\" image = \"myregistry/app3:latest\" labels { [\"app.kubernetes.io/instance\"] = \"\\(name)-staging\" } deployment { spec { template { spec { securityContext { runAsNonRoot = true } initContainers { new { name = \"my-init-container\" // ... } } } } } } resources { new NetworkPolicy { // ... } } }.resources","title":"Class-as-a-Function Pattern","component":"blog","version":"","name":"class-as-a-function","url":"/blog/class-as-a-function.html","titles":[{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage","id":1},{"text":"Example","hash":"example","id":2},{"text":"Tips","hash":"tips","id":3},{"text":"Multi-directional Functions","hash":"multi-directional-functions","id":4},{"text":"Building Abstractions","hash":"building-abstractions","id":5}]},"83":{"id":83,"text":"by Islon Scherer on October 15th, 2024 One of the main points of using Pkl is to describe what your configuration looks like.

When thinking about configuration, it is common to think of static languages like JSON, YAML, or Property Lists. While these languages have their own merits, they tend to fall short when configuration grows in complexity. For example, their lack of expressivity means that code often gets repeated. Additionally, it can be easy to make configuration errors, because these formats do not provide any validation of their own. To address these shortcomings, sometimes formats get enhanced by ancillary tools that add special logic. For example, perhaps there’s a need to make code more DRY, so a special property is introduced that understands how to resolve references, and merge objects together. Alternatively, there’s a need to guard against validation errors, so some new way is created to validate a configuration value against an expected type. Before long, these formats almost become programming languages, but ones that are hard to understand and hard to write. On the other end of the spectrum, a general-purpose language might be used instead. Languages like Kotlin, Ruby, or JavaScript become the basis for DSLs that generate configuration data. While these languages are tremendously powerful, they can be awkward to use for describing configuration, because they are not oriented around defining and validating data. Additionally, these DSLs tend to be tied to their own ecosystems. It is a hard sell to use a Kotlin DSL as the configuration layer for an application written in Go. We created Pkl because we think that configuration is best expressed as a blend between a static language and a general-purpose programming language. We want to take the best of both worlds; to provide a language that is declarative and simple to read and write, but enhanced with capabilities borrowed from general-purpose languages. When writing Pkl, you are able to use the language features you’d expect, like classes, functions, conditionals, and loops. You can build abstraction layers, and share code by creating packages and publishing them. Most importantly, you can use Pkl to meet many different types of configuration needs. It can be used to produce static configuration files in any format, or be embedded as a library into another application runtime. We designed Pkl with three overarching goals: To provide safety by catching validation errors before deployment. To scale from simple to complex use-cases. To be a joy to write, with our best-in-class IDE integrations. We created Pkl to have a familiar syntax to developers, and to be easy to learn. That is why we’ve included features like classes, functions, loops, and type annotations. For example, here is a Pkl file (module) that defines a configuration schema for an imaginary web application. This file defines types, and not data. This is a common pattern in Pkl, and we call this a template. Application.pkl module Application /// The hostname that this server responds to. hostname: String /// The port to listen on. port: UInt16 /// The environment to deploy to. environment: Environment /// The database connection for this application database: Database class Database { /// The username for this database. username: String /// The password for this database. password: String /// The remote host for this database. host: String /// The remote port for this database. port: UInt16 /// The name of the database. dbName: String } typealias Environment = \"dev\"|\"qa\"|\"prod\" And here is how configuration data might be defined: localhost.pkl amends \"Application.pkl\" hostname = \"localhost\" port = 3599 environment = \"dev\" database { host = \"localhost\" port = 5786 username = \"admin\" password = read(\"env:DATABASE_PASSWORD\") (1) dbName = \"myapp\" } 1 Built-in read expression for reading external resources. It is easy to create variations of the same base data by amending. For example, let’s imagine that we want to run four databases locally, as sidecars. This uses a for generator to produce four variations, each of which amends the base db and specifies a different port. sidecars.pkl import \"Application.pkl\" hidden db: Application.Database = new { host = \"localhost\" username = \"admin\" password = read(\"env:DATABASE_PASSWORD\") dbName = \"myapp\" } sidecars { for (offset in List(0, 1, 2, 3)) { (db) { port = 6000 + offset } } } Pkl programs can be easily rendered to common formats. YAML JSON XML $ export DATABASE_PASSWORD=hunter2 $ pkl eval --format yaml sidecars.pkl sidecars: - username: admin password: hunter2 host: localhost port: 6000 dbName: myapp - username: admin password: hunter2 host: localhost port: 6001 dbName: myapp - username: admin password: hunter2 host: localhost port: 6002 dbName: myapp - username: admin password: hunter2 host: localhost port: 6003 dbName: myapp $ export DATABASE_PASSWORD=hunter2 $ pkl eval --format json sidecars.pkl { \"sidecars\": [ { \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\": \"hunter2\", \"host\": \"localhost\", \"port\": 6000, \"dbName\": \"myapp\" }, { \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\": \"hunter2\", \"host\": \"localhost\", \"port\": 6001, \"dbName\": \"myapp\" }, { \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\": \"hunter2\", \"host\": \"localhost\", \"port\": 6002, \"dbName\": \"myapp\" }, { \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\": \"hunter2\", \"host\": \"localhost\", \"port\": 6003, \"dbName\": \"myapp\" } ] } $ export DATABASE_PASSWORD=hunter2 $ pkl eval --format xml sidecars.pkl admin hunter2 localhost 6000 myapp admin hunter2 localhost 6001 myapp admin hunter2 localhost 6002 myapp admin hunter2 localhost 6003 myapp Configuration is about data. And data needs to be valid. In Pkl, validation is achieved using type annotations. And, type annotations can optionally have constraints defined on them. Here is an example, that defines the following constraints: age must be between 0 and 130. name to not be empty. zipCode must be a string with five digits. Person.pkl module Person name: String(!isEmpty) age: Int(isBetween(0, 130)) zipCode: String(matches(Regex(\"\\\\d{5}\"))) A failing constraint causes an evaluation error. alessandra.pkl amends \"Person.pkl\" name = \"Alessandra\" age = -5 zipCode = \"90210\" Evaluating this module fails: $ pkl eval alessandra.pkl –– Pkl Error –– Type constraint `isBetween(0, 130)` violated. Value: -5 5 | age: Int(isBetween(0, 130)) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ at Person#age (file:///Person.pkl) 5 | age = -5 ^^ at alessandra#age (file:///alessandra.pkl) 106 | text = renderer.renderDocument(value) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ at pkl.base#Module.output.text (https://github.com/apple/pkl/blob/0.25.0/stdlib/base.pkl#L106) Constraints are arbitrary expressions. This allows you to author types that can express any type of check that can be expressed in Pkl. Here is a sample type that must be a string with an odd length, and whose first letter matches the last letter. name: String(length.isOdd, chars.first == chars.last) Pkl provides the ability to publish packages, and to import them as dependencies in a project. This provides an easy way to share Pkl code that can be used in other projects. It is easy to create your own package and publish them as GitHub releases, or to upload them anywhere you wish. Packages can be imported via the absolute URI: import \"package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-pantry/pkl.toml@1.0.0#/toml.pkl\" output { renderer = new toml.Renderer {} } Alternatively, they can be managed as dependencies of a project. Using a project allows Pkl to resolve version conflicts between different versions of the same dependency within a dependency graph. It also means that you can import packages by a simpler name. PklProject amends \"pkl:Project\" dependencies { [\"toml\"] { uri = \"package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-pantry/pkl.toml@1.0.0\" } } myconfig.pkl import \"@toml/toml.pkl\" output { renderer = new toml.Renderer {} } A set of packages are maintained by us, the Pkl team. These include: pkl-pantry — a monorepo that publishes many different packages. pkl-k8s — templates for defining Kubernetes descriptors. Pkl can produce configuration as textual output, and it can also be embedded as a library into other languages via our language bindings. When binding to a language, Pkl schema can be generated as classes/structs in the target language. For example, the Application.pkl example from above can be generated into Swift, Go, Java, and Kotlin. Pkl even includes documentation comments in the target language. Swift Go Java Kotlin import PklSwift public enum Application {} extension Application { public enum Environment: String, CaseIterable, Decodable, Hashable { case dev = \"dev\" case qa = \"qa\" case prod = \"prod\" } public struct Module: PklRegisteredType, Decodable, Hashable { public static var registeredIdentifier: String = \"Application\" /// The hostname that this server responds to. public var hostname: String /// The port to listen on. public var port: UInt16 /// The environment to deploy to. public var environment: Environment /// The database connection for this application public var database: Database public init(hostname: String, port: UInt16, environment: Environment, database: Database) { self.hostname = hostname self.port = port self.environment = environment self.database = database } } public struct Database: PklRegisteredType, Decodable, Hashable { public static var registeredIdentifier: String = \"Application#Database\" /// The username for this database. public var username: String /// The password for this database. public var password: String /// The remote host for this database. public var host: String /// The remote port for this database. public var port: UInt16 /// The name of the database. public var dbName: String public init(username: String, password: String, host: String, port: UInt16, dbName: String) { self.username = username self.password = password self.host = host self.port = port self.dbName = dbName } } } Application.pkl.go package application type Application struct { // The hostname that this server responds to.

Our language bindings also provide evaluator APIs to control Pkl evaluation at a low level, and users are free to interact with Pkl at the abstraction level that makes the most sense for their application. We believe that a programming language is only as good as the experience of writing it. That is why we aim to provide best-in-class editor support. When writing Pkl in an editor, users are guided through the process of filling in configuration data from a given template. Additionally, the editors provide instant feedback if any values are invalid, and documentation is immediately available when called upon. We are also releasing our IntelliJ plugin, which provides rich support for JetBrains editors, including IntelliJ, Webstorm, GoLand, and PyCharm. These plugins are able to analyze a Pkl program and provide features like autocompletion, go-to-definition, and refactoring support. Here are some of the features that are available: Autocompletion Navigation Validation In addition, we are also planning on supporting the Language Server Protocol, which will provide a similar level of integration in other editors. As of 2024/10/10, The Pkl Language Server has been released. This enables rich editor support for our VS Code and Neovim plugins. We hope you like what we’ve shown you so far. For a more in-depth guide, take a look at our tutorial. To learn more about the language itself, read through our language reference. To connect with us, feel free to submit a topic on GitHub Discussions. Additionally, feel free to browse our sample repositories to get an idea for what it’s like to use Pkl: https://github.com/apple/pkl-go-examples https://github.com/apple/pkl-jvm-examples https://github.com/apple/pkl-k8s-examples https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift-examples To try out Pkl locally, try downloading our CLI by following our installation guide. Additionally, try installing one of our various editor plugins to get a glimpse of what it’s like to write Pkl yourself. We’re so excited to share Pkl with you, and we are just getting started. We are looking forward to seeing what you might do with it!","title":"Introducing Pkl, a programming language for configuration","component":"blog","version":"","name":"introducing-pkl","url":"/blog/introducing-pkl.html","titles":[{"text":"A Quick Tour of Pkl","hash":"a-quick-tour-of-pkl","id":1},{"text":"Built-in Validation","hash":"built-in-validation","id":2},{"text":"Sharing Packages","hash":"sharing-packages","id":3},{"text":"Language Bindings","hash":"language-bindings","id":4},{"text":"Editor Support","hash":"editor-support","id":5},{"text":"Next Steps","hash":"next-steps","id":6}]},"85":{"id":85,"text":"by Dan Chao on April 29th, 2024 Today, we launch Pkl Evolution, a new repository that holds Suggested Pkl Improvements, Changes, or Enhancements (SPICEs) for Pkl’s language, tooling, and ecosystem. The purpose of the Pkl Evolution repository is to provide visibility to the community how design decisions are made in Pkl. Additionally, it is a place for the Pkl maintainers to get feedback as in-flight proposals are being considered. The process for a SPICE is: The SPICE is authored, and submitted as a pull request. When authoring a SPICE, determine your SPICE number by adding one to the latest SPICE (inclusive of open pull requests). The contents of the SPICE are discussed and reviewed in the pull request. It is then either accepted or rejected. The status of the SPICE is updated, and the pull request is merged. Both accepted and rejected SPICEs get merged into the main branch. The acceptance of a SPICE does not need to block any implementation work. On the contrary, it can be quite useful to have an implementation ready to go during the process of review. The acceptance of a SPICE depends on consensus from the Pkl maintainers. There are two main ways you can participate and contribute to Pkl Evolution. The first way is to participate in the pull request discussion for a SPICE. Your thoughts and opinions are valuable to us, and can help shape the direction of the language. The second way is to author SPICEs of your own. If you would like to contribute your own SPICE, we recommend you first the idea to GitHub Discussions to solicit feedback. This can help shape the direction of the SPICE before too much work goes in. It can also potentially filter out ideas that are non-starters. Some of you might recognize how similar this is to Swift Evolution. If you’ve noticed that, you’re totally right! We borrowed much of this from the Swift folks. Compared to Swift Evolution, we are choosing to keep our process relatively light-weight. There is no review manager, and no designated review period. This is an intentional choice on our part, and we expect that our own process will evolve over time.","title":"Pkl Evolution","component":"blog","version":"","name":"pkl-evolution","url":"/blog/pkl-evolution.html","titles":[{"text":"Process for SPICEs","hash":"process-for-spices","id":1},{"text":"Contributing to Pkl Evolution","hash":"contributing-to-pkl-evolution","id":2},{"text":"Status of Pkl Evolution","hash":"status-of-pkl-evolution","id":3}]},"86":{"id":86,"text":"by Dan Chao on April 9th, 2024 Pkl files are programs that get evaluated to produce a result. Like any other program, it can be useful to have tests that verify their business logic. To address this, Pkl provides tooling for writing and running tests. Tests in Pkl are modules that amend standard library module pkl.test. These modules can describe facts, and examples. Facts are boolean assertions. They are useful for unit tests, where the behavior of functions, types, or any expression can be tested. If an expression evaluates to false, the test case is considered failing. Below is a naïve test about the qualities of the integer 1, where the last expression fails. math.pkl amends \"pkl:test\" facts { [\"one\"] { 1.isOdd 1.isBetween(0, 3) 1 == 2 } } Running this test provides a report about the failing test. $ pkl test math.pkl module test facts ✘ one 1 == 2 (file:///math.pkl, line 7) 0.0% tests pass [1/1 failed], 66.7% asserts pass [1/3 failed] facts in Pkl are most useful for writing fine-grained assertions about specific behavior of your code. The tests for module pkl.experimental.uri are a good example of facts in practice. There are multiple facts, where each fact contains multiple assertions which cover different cases of business logic: URI.pkl#L27-L36 facts { [\"encode\"] { URI.encode(\"https://example.com/some path\") == \"https://example.com/some%20path\" URI.encode(alphaLower) == alphaLower URI.encode(alphaUpper) == alphaUpper URI.encode(nums) == nums local safeChars = \"!#$&'()*+,-./:;=?@_~\" URI.encode(safeChars) == safeChars URI.encode(\"\\u{ffff}\") == \"%EF%BF%BF\" URI.encode(\"🏀\") == \"%F0%9F%8F%80\" } Examples are values that get compared to expected values. When first testing an example, its value gets written to a sibling file that ends in pkl-expected.pcf. The next time the test is run, the example value is then asserted to be equal to that expected value. If they are not equal, the test fails. Here is a quick tutorial for writing an example. First, we create a test module with our example. In this case, we are checking the behavior of an imagined Person class. For simplicity’s sake, we are just declaring it as a local class. person.pkl amends \"pkl:test\" local class Person { firstName: String lastName: String fullName: String = \"\\(firstName) \\(lastName)\" } examples { [\"person\"] { new Person { firstName = \"Johnny\" lastName = \"Appleseed\" } } } This test then gets run: pkl test person.pkl On the first run, Pkl tells us that the corresponding expected value was written. module test examples ✍️ person 1 examples written This creates a file called person.pkl-expected.pcf in the same directory. The directory tree now looks like this: . ├── person.pkl └── person.pkl-expected.pcf We can inspect the contents of the pkl-expected.pcf to see what the expected value is. person.pkl-expected.pcf examples { [\"person\"] { new { firstName = \"Johnny\" lastName = \"Appleseed\" fullName = \"Johnny Appleseed\" } } } Running pkl test person.pkl again now shows that it passes. module test examples ✔ person 100.0% tests pass [1 passed], 100.0% asserts pass [1 passed] Now, we’ll change \"Johnny\" to \"Sally\", to demonstrate a test failure. examples { [\"person\"] { new Person { - firstName = \"Johnny\" + firstName = \"Sally\" lastName = \"Appleseed\" } } } Running pkl test person.pkl again fails. module test examples ✘ person #0: (file:///test.pkl, line 13) Expected: (file:///test.pkl-expected.pcf, line 3) new { firstName = \"Johnny\" lastName = \"Appleseed\" fullName = \"Johnny Appleseed\" } Actual: (file:///test.pkl-actual.pcf, line 3) new { firstName = \"Sally\" lastName = \"Appleseed\" fullName = \"Sally Appleseed\" } 0.0% tests pass [1/1 failed], 0.0% asserts pass [1/1 failed] Because the test failed, Pkl writes a new file to the same directory. The directory tree now looks like this: . ├── person.pkl ├── person.pkl-actual.pcf └── person.pkl-expected.pcf It can be especially useful to use diff to compare the pkl-actual.pcf file with the pkl-expected.pcf file. diff -c person.pkl-actual.pcf person.pkl-expected.pcf --- person.pkl-actual.pcf 2024-03-28 15:33:15 +++ person.pkl-expected.pcf 2024-03-28 15:15:00 @@ -1,9 +1,9 @@ examples { [\"person\"] { new { - firstName = \"Sally\" + firstName = \"Johnny\" lastName = \"Appleseed\" - fullName = \"Sally Appleseed\" + fullName = \"Johnny Appleseed\" } } } For intentional changes, add the --overwrite flag. This will overwrite the expected output file, and also remove the pkl-actual.pcf file. $ pkl test person.pkl --overwrite module test examples ✍️ person 1 examples written A common pattern is to use examples to test how Pkl renders into static configuration. Pkl is idiomatically split between schema and data. Base Pkl modules define schema and rendering logic (colloquially called templates), and downstream modules amend those base modules with just data. Here is an imagined Pkl template for configuring a logger. It defines some converters for DataSize and Duration, and also sets the output renderer to YAML. Logger.pkl module Logger /// The list of targets to send log output to. targets: Listing abstract class LogTarget { /// The logging level to write at. logLevel: \"info\"|\"warn\"|\"error\" } class RotatingFileTarget extends LogTarget { /// The max file size maxSize: DataSize? /// The directory to write log lines to. directory: String } class NetworkLogTarget extends LogTarget { /// The network URL to send log lines to. connectionString: Uri /// The timeout before the connection gets killed. timeout: Duration? } output { renderer = new YamlRenderer { converters { [DataSize] = (it) -> \"\\(it.unit)\\(it.value)\" [Duration] = (it) -> it.isoString } } } After having written this template, we’d like to test to see what our YAML output actually looks like. We’d also like to provide some sample code for our users, that demonstrate how to use our template. To do this, we’ll first create some examples modules, in an examples/ directory. examples/rotatingLogger.pkl amends \"../Logger.pkl\" targets { new RotatingFileTarget { maxSize = 5.mb directory = \"/vat/etc/log\" } } examples/networkLogger.pkl amends \"../Logger.pkl\" targets { new NetworkLogTarget { timeout = 5.s connectionString = \"https://example.com/foo/bar\" } } With this set up, we can now use them as test examples. tests/Logger.pkl module tests.Logger amends \"pkl:test\" import* \"../examples/*.pkl\" as allExamples examples { for (key in allExamples.keys) { (1) [key.drop(\"../examples/\".length).replaceLast(\"pkl\", \"yml\")] { (2) allExamples[key].output.text } } } 1 Iterates over the keys only as a workaround for a current bug where for-generators are eager in values. This ensures that any errors related to loading the module are captured as related to that specific example. 2 Sets the test name to .yml These tests are defined as evaluating each module’s output.text property. This emulates the behavior of the Pkl CLI when it evaluates a module through pkl eval. Furthermore, the tests uses a glob import to bulk-import these example modules. This means that if we add new modules to the examples/ directory, they are automatically added as a new test. Running this test creates expected output: $ pkl test tests/Logger.pkl module tests.Logger examples ✍️ networkLogger.yml ✍️ rotatingLogger.yml 2 examples written By default, Pkl writes a simple test report to console. Optionally, it can also produce JUnit-style reports by setting the --junit-reports flag. Example: pkl test --junit-reports .out In Pkl, a project is a directory of Pkl modules that is tied together with the presence of a PklProject file. There are many reasons for wanting to define a project. One reason is to simplify the pkl test command. If pkl test is run without any input source modules, it will run all tests defined in the PklProject. PklProject amends \"pkl:Project\" tests { ...import*(\"tests/**.pkl\").keys } When creating a package, it is also possible to specify apiTests. These are tests for the external API of this package. The intention of this is to allow checking for breaking changes when updating a version. When publishing a new version of the same package, running apiTests of a previous package can inform whether the package’s major version needs to be bumped or not. The apiTests are also run when the package is created via pkl project package. Testing in Pkl is already tremendously useful. With that said, there is still room improvements. One feature that we would like to implement is power assert style reporting. Power assertions are a form of reporting that displays a diagram that shows parts of the syntax tree, and their resolved values. A power-assertion report might look like: module test facts ✘ math num1 == num2 | | | | false | 1 2 This feature improves the developer experience when testing facts. Currently, only the expression is printed, as well as a report that the test failed. In lieu of this feature, trace() expressions can be used to add more debugging output. Frameworks that provide power assertions include Spock, power-assert-js, and swift-power-assert.","title":"Testing in Pkl","component":"blog","version":"","name":"testing-in-pkl","url":"/blog/testing-in-pkl.html","titles":[{"text":"Writing Tests","hash":"writing-tests","id":1},{"text":"Facts","hash":"facts","id":2},{"text":"Examples","hash":"examples","id":3},{"text":"Pattern: Testing JSON, YAML and other module output","hash":"pattern-testing-json-yaml-and-other-module-output","id":4},{"text":"Reporting","hash":"reporting","id":5},{"text":"Interaction with pkl:Project","hash":"interaction-with-pklproject","id":6},{"text":"A note on apiTests","hash":"a-note-on-apitests","id":7},{"text":"Future improvements: power assertions","hash":"future-improvements-power-assertions","id":8}]},"87":{"id":87,"text":"by Islon Scherer on October 15th, 2024 One of the main points of using Pkl is to describe what your configuration looks like. An often overlooked design goal (arguably, the most important), is to forbid invalid configurations. Pkl types allow a great degree of freedom and power in constraining what your data looks like. Some developers, especially those coming from more general purpose languages like Swift, Go, or Java, may have a pre-defined notion of how types can help them. So let’s have a look at how Pkl can go beyond most traditional types. String is a type we tend to see everywhere. This is especially true in configuration languages, where a String can be used as a \"joker\" type for many different values. A typical usage of Strings is to define a finite set of values that your property can take: /// The environment where this service is running. /// /// Valid possibilities are \"dev\", \"qa\" and \"prod\". env: String This works, but has the problem that users of your template can provide invalid data, like \"foo\". So let’s do better: /// The environment where this service is running. env: \"dev\"|\"qa\"|\"prod\" Now env will reject any invalid possibility. If you’re using an IDE, like the IntelliJ plugin, this has the added benefits of providing autocomplete and telling you when a given value is invalid. In Pkl, strings are not only values; they can also be types. Another typical use for strings is to allow values that have a specific shape: /// The IPv4 to connect serverIp: String Again, we can do better to validate that the given ip is correct: /// The IPv4 to connect serverIp: String(matches(Regex(#\"((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\\d|[1-9]|)\\d)\\.?\\b){4}\"#))) (1) Strings can be constrained to match specific regular expressions. The new serverIp will only allow values of a specific shape, greatly reducing the possibility of invalid configs. name: String(!isBlank) (1) email: String(contains(\"@\")) (2) swiftFile: String(endsWith(\".swift\")) (3) contentType: \"text/plain\"|\"text/html\"|\"application/json\"|String (4) 1 name cannot be empty or a blank String. 2 email must contain a @ symbol. 3 A Swift file must have the correct extension. 4 Declaring some common possibilities before the generic type is a useful pattern that results in better tooling support in IDEs. There are plenty of ways to make our types more fine-grained than just String, but strings are not the only types we can refine in Pkl. Pkl comes with some useful typealiases for numbers like Int16, UInt8, etc. serverPort: UInt16 (1) 1 Will only allow values between 0 and 65535, inclusive. Builtin typealiases are not the only way to handle such cases, though. Numbers can be constrained to any value. volume: Float(isBetween(0.0, 11.0)) (1) multiplier: Int(isEven) (2) 1 volume can only be in the range between 0 and 11. 2 multiplier cannot be odd. Up to now, we only took a look at builtin functions, mostly functions of the type itself. We also limited our types to a single constraint. Pkl allows, though, for arbitrary functions as constraints, and we can provide multiple ones: local isPrime = (n: Int) -> n > 1 && IntSeq(2, n - 1).toList().every((x) -> n % x != 0) hash: Int(isPrime) (1) region: String(startsWith(\"us-\"), length str.matches(Regex(#\"\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}\"#)) ssn: String(isValidSocialSecurityNumber) = \"123-123-123\" –– Pkl Error –– Type constraint `isValidSocialSecurityNumber` violated. Value: \"123-123-123\" 4 | ssn: String(isValidSocialSecurityNumber) = \"123-123-123\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ... That’s already better. Users now have a hint of what they did wrong. Sometimes, it can be useful to provide your own custom error messages. Pkl doesn’t provide a built-in way to do this, but one pattern to hack around this limitation is to use throw. This approach can be a footgun. See Dangers of throw for details. With the knowledge that failing constraints will throw an exception, we can provide a custom error message by throwing the exception ourselves: local function reportSSN(ssn: String) = \"\"\" Invalid social security number: \\(ssn). Valid ones should be in the form `XXX-XX-XXXX` where `X` is a number between 0 and 9. \"\"\" ssn: String(matches(Regex(#\"\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}\"#)) || throw(reportSSN(this))) = \"123-123-123\" –– Pkl Error –– Invalid social security number: 123-123-123. Valid ones should be in the form `XXX-XX-XXXX` where `X` is a number between 0 and 9. 8 | ssn: String(matches(Regex(#\"\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}\"#)) || throw(reportSSN(this))) = \"123-123-123\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ... Now users know exactly what the problem is and how to fix it. Using throw to give a better error report is a powerful tool, but it comes with its own set of downsides that we have to be aware of. Throwing exceptions inside constraints will short-circuit and stop execution immediately, so it doesn’t compose very well: typealias SSN = String(matches(Regex(#\"\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}\"#)) || throw(\"Invalid SSN ...\")) typealias NIN = String(matches(Regex(#\"[A-Z]{2}\\d{6}[A-Z]\"#)) || throw(\"Invalid NIN ...\")) taxId: SSN|NIN = \"AB123456C\" –– Pkl Error –– Invalid SSN ... 1 | typealias SSN = String(matches(Regex(#\"\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}\"#)) || throw(\"Invalid SSN ...\")) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ... That wasn’t expected. Because of the eager nature of throw, we have to be careful when to use it and to not compose it with other constraints.","title":"Taking types to the next
