Pkl files are programs that get evaluated to produce a result.
Like any other program, it can be useful to have tests that verify their business logic.
To address this, Pkl provides tooling for writing and running tests.
// end::excerpt[]

== Writing Tests

Tests in Pkl are modules that amend standard library module link:https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/pkl/current/test/index.html[pkl.test].

These modules can describe <<facts,`facts`>>, and <<examples,`examples`>>.

[[facts]]
=== Facts

Facts are boolean assertions.
They are useful for unit tests, where the behavior of functions, types, or any expression can be tested.

If an expression evaluates to `false`, the test case is considered failing.

Below is a na√Øve test about the qualities of the integer `1`, where the last expression fails.

.math.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
amends "pkl:test"

facts {
  ["one"] {
    1.isOdd
    1.isBetween(0, 3)
    1 == 2
  }
}
----

Running this test provides a report about the failing test.

[source]
----
$ pkl test math.pkl
module math (file:///math.pkl, line 1)
  math ‚ùå
    1 == 2 ‚ùå (file:///math.pkl, line 6)
----

`facts` in Pkl are most useful for writing fine-grained assertions about specific behavior of your code.

The tests for module `pkl.experimental.uri` are a good example of `facts` in practice. There are multiple facts, where each fact contains multiple assertions which cover different cases of business logic:

[source,pkl]
----
facts {
  ["encode"] {
    URI.encode("https://example.com/some path") == "https://example.com/some%20path"
    URI.encode(alphaLower) == alphaLower
    URI.encode(alphaUpper) == alphaUpper
    URI.encode(nums) == nums

    local safeChars = "!#$&'()*+,-./:;=?@_~"
    URI.encode(safeChars) == safeChars
    URI.encode("\u{ffff}") == "%EF%BF%BF"
    URI.encode("üèÄ") == "%F0%9F%8F%80"
  }
----

[[examples]]
=== Examples

Examples are values that get compared to _expected_ values.
When first testing an example, its value gets written to a sibling file that ends in `pkl-expected.pcf`.
The next time the test is run, the example value is then asserted to be equal to that expected value.
If they are not equal, the test fails.

Here is a quick tutorial for writing an example.
First, we create a test module with our example.
In this case, we are checking the behavior of an imagined `Person` class.
For simplicity's sake, we are just declaring it as a local class.

.person.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
amends "pkl:test"

local class Person {
  firstName: String

  lastName: String

  fullName: String = "\(firstName) \(lastName)"
}

examples {
  ["person"] {
    new Person {
      firstName = "Johnny"
      lastName = "Appleseed"
    }
  }
}
----

This test then gets run:

[source,shell]
----
pkl test person.pkl
----

On the first run, Pkl tells us that the corresponding expected value was written.

[source]
----
module person (file:///person.pkl, line 1)
  person ‚úçÔ∏è
----

This creates a file called `person.pkl-expected.pcf` in the same directory.
The directory tree now looks like this:

[source]
----
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ person.pkl
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ person.pkl-expected.pcf
----

We can inspect the contents of the `pkl-expected.pcf` to see what the expected value is.

.person.pkl-expected.pcf
[source,pkl]
----
examples {
  ["person"] {
    new {
      firstName = "Johnny"
      lastName = "Appleseed"
      fullName = "Johnny Appleseed"
    }
  }
}
----

Running `pkl test person.pkl` again now shows that it passes.

[source]
----
module person (file:///person.pkl, line 1)
  person ‚úÖ
----

Now, we'll change "Johnny" to "Sally", to demonstrate a test failure.

[source,diff]
----
 examples {
   ["person"] {
     new Person {
-      firstName = "Johnny"
+      firstName = "Sally"
       lastName = "Appleseed"
     }
   }
 }
----

Running `pkl test person.pkl` again fails.

[source]
----
module Person (file:///person.pkl, line 1)
  person ‚ùå
    (file:///person.pkl, line 13)
    Expected: (file:///person.pkl-expected.pcf, line 3)
    new {
      firstName = "Johnny"
      lastName = "Appleseed"
      fullName = "Johnny Appleseed"
    }
    Actual: (file:///person.pkl-actual.pcf, line 3)
    new {
      firstName = "Sally"
      lastName = "Appleseed"
      fullName = "Sally Appleseed"
    }

----

Because the test failed, Pkl writes a new file to the same directory. The directory tree now looks like this:

[source]
----
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ person.pkl
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ person.pkl-actual.pcf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ person.pkl-expected.pcf
----

It can be especially useful to use `diff` to compare the `pkl-actual.pcf` file with the `pkl-expected.pcf` file.

[source,shell]
----
diff -c person.pkl-actual.pcf person.pkl-expected.pcf
----

[source,diff]
----
--- person.pkl-actual.pcf    2024-03-28 15:33:15

     new {

       lastName = "Appleseed"
-      fullName = "Sally Appleseed"
+      fullName = "Johnny Appleseed"
     }
   }
 }
----

For intentional changes, add the `--overwrite` flag. This will overwrite the expected output file, and also remove the `pkl-actual.pcf` file.

[source]
----
$ pkl test person.pkl --overwrite
module person (file:///person.pkl, line 1)
  person ‚úçÔ∏è

==== Pattern: Testing JSON, YAML and other module output

A common pattern is to use `examples` to test how Pkl renders into static configuration.

Pkl is idiomatically split between _schema_ and _data_.
Base Pkl modules define schema and rendering logic (colloquially called templates), and downstream modules amend those base modules with just data.

Here is an imagined Pkl template for configuring a logger.
It defines some converters for `DataSize` and `Duration`, and also sets the output renderer to YAML.

.Logger.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
module Logger

/// The list of targets to send log output to.
targets: Listing<LogTarget>

abstract class LogTarget {
  /// The logging level to write at.
  logLevel: "info"|"warn"|"error"
}

class RotatingFileTarget extends LogTarget {
  /// The max file size
  maxSize: DataSize?

  /// The directory to write log lines to.
  directory: String
}

class NetworkLogTarget extends LogTarget {
  /// The network URL to send log lines to.
  connectionString: Uri

  /// The timeout before the connection gets killed.
  timeout: Duration?
}

output {
  renderer = new YamlRenderer {
    converters {
      [DataSize] = (it) -> "\(it.unit)\(it.value)"
      [Duration] = (it) -> it.isoString
    }
  }
}
----

After having written this template, we'd like to test to see what our YAML output actually looks like.
We'd also like to provide some sample code for our users, that demonstrate how to use our template.

To do this, we'll first create some examples modules, in an `examples/` directory.

.examples/rotatingLogger.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
amends "../Logger.pkl"

targets {
  new RotatingFileTarget {
    maxSize = 5.mb
    directory = "/vat/etc/log"
  }
}
----

.examples/networkLogger.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
amends "../Logger.pkl"

targets {
  new NetworkLogTarget {
    timeout = 5.s
    connectionString = "https://example.com/foo/bar"
  }
}
----

With this set up, we can now use them as test examples.

.tests/Logger.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
module tests.Logger

amends "pkl:test"

import* "../examples/*.pkl" as allExamples

examples {
  for (key in allExamples.keys) { // <1>
    [key.drop("../examples/".length).replaceLast("pkl", "yml")] { // <2>
      allExamples[key].output.text
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Iterates over the keys only as a workaround for a current bug where link:https://github.com/apple/pkl/issues/398[for-generators are eager in values]. This ensures that any errors related to loading the module are captured as related to that specific example.
<2> Sets the test name to `<filename>.yml`

These tests are defined as evaluating each module's `output.text` property.
This emulates the behavior of the Pkl CLI when it evaluates a module through `pkl eval`.

Furthermore, the tests uses a xref:main:language-reference:index.adoc#globbed-imports[glob import] to bulk-import these example modules.
This means that if we add new modules to the `examples/` directory, they are automatically added as a new test.

Running this test creates expected output:

[source]
----
pkl test tests/Logger.pkl
module tests.Logger (file:///tests/Logger.pkl, line 1)
  networkLogger.yml ‚úçÔ∏è
  rotatingLogger.yml ‚úçÔ∏è
----

== Reporting

By default, Pkl writes a simple test report to console.
Optionally, it can also produce JUnit-style reports by setting the `--junit-reports` flag.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
pkl test --junit-reports .out
----

== Interaction with `pkl:Project`

In Pkl, a xref:main:language-reference:index.adoc#projects[project] is a directory of Pkl modules that is tied together with the presence of a PklProject file.

There are many reasons for wanting to define a project.
One reason is to simplify the `pkl test` command.
If `pkl test` is run without any input source modules, it will run all tests defined in the `PklProject`.

.PklProject
[source,pkl]
----
amends "pkl:Project"

tests {
  ...import("tests/**.pkl").keys
}
----

=== A note on `apiTests`

When xref:main:language-reference:index.adoc#creating-a-package[creating a package], it is also possible to specify `apiTests`.
These are tests for the _external API_ of this package.
The intention of this is to allow checking for breaking changes when updating a version.
When publishing a new version of the same package, running `apiTests` of a previous package can inform whether the package's major version needs to be bumped or not.

The `apiTests` are also run when the package is created via `pkl project package`.

== Future improvements: power assertions

Testing in Pkl is already tremendously useful.
With that said, there is still room improvements.

One feature that we would like to implement is power assert style reporting.
Power assertions are a form of reporting that displays a diagram that shows parts of the syntax tree, and their resolved values.

A power-assertion report might look like:

[source]
----
module test
  math ‚ùå
    num1 == num2 ‚ùå
     |   |   |
     | false |
     1       2
----

This feature improves the developer experience when testing <<facts,facts>>.
Currently, only the expression is printed, as well as a report that the test failed.

In lieu of this feature, link:https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/language-reference/index.html#debugging[`trace()`] expressions can be used to add more debugging output.

Frameworks that provide power assertions include link:https://github.com/spockframework/spock[Spock], link:https://github.com/power-assert-js/power-assert[power-assert-js], and link:https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/swift-power-assert[swift-power-assert].
